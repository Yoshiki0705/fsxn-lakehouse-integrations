# KPI and PoC Validation Guide

## Overview

This document defines measurable success criteria for FSx for ONTAP Lakehouse integration PoCs. Without clear KPIs, it is impossible to evaluate whether a PoC succeeded or failed. Each metric includes a measurement method and target range.

## Core KPIs

### 1. Query Latency

| Metric | Definition | Measurement Method | Target (Good Tier) | Target (Best Tier) |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Cold query latency | Time from query submission to first result (no cache) | Athena/Databricks query execution time | < 30s for 1 GB scan | < 10s for 1 GB scan |
| Warm query latency | Time with data in FSx NVMe/memory cache | Repeated query execution time | < 10s for 1 GB scan | < 5s for 1 GB scan |
| Metadata query latency | Time for schema/partition discovery | Glue Catalog API response time | < 5s | < 2s |

**How to measure**:
```sql
-- Athena: Check query execution time in console or via API
SELECT query_execution_id, 
       total_execution_time_in_millis,
       data_scanned_in_bytes
FROM information_schema.__query_log__
WHERE query LIKE '%your_table%'
ORDER BY submission_date_time DESC;
```

### 2. Throughput

| Metric | Definition | Measurement Method | Target |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| Read throughput | MB/s sustained during table scan | CloudWatch `DataReadBytes` / query duration | ≥ 80% of FSx provisioned throughput |
| Write throughput | MB/s during ETL write-back | CloudWatch `DataWriteBytes` / write duration | ≥ 50% of FSx provisioned throughput |
| Concurrent query throughput | Aggregate throughput under concurrent load | Multiple simultaneous queries | Linear scaling up to provisioned limit |

**Note**: S3 API throughput via access points depends on FSx file system provisioned throughput capacity. This is NOT equivalent to native S3 throughput. ([source](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/performance.html))

### 3. Cost per TB Scanned

| Metric | Definition | Measurement Method | Target |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| Athena cost/TB | Athena query cost per TB scanned | $5/TB (Athena pricing) + FSx throughput cost | < $10/TB total |
| Storage cost/TB | Monthly storage cost per TB | FSx SSD + capacity pool pricing | Compare vs. S3 Standard + ETL pipeline cost |
| Total cost of ownership | Storage + compute + data transfer | Monthly bill analysis | < current NAS + S3 copy pipeline cost |

**Cost comparison framework**:
```
Current state cost:
  NAS storage: $X/TB/month
  + S3 copy storage: $Y/TB/month  
  + ETL pipeline compute: $Z/month
  + Data transfer: $W/month
  = Total: $(X+Y+Z+W)/month

FSx S3 AP state cost:
  FSx storage: $A/TB/month
  + Analytics compute: $B/month
  + No S3 copy: $0
  + No ETL pipeline: $0
  = Total: $(A+B)/month

Savings = Current - FSx S3 AP
```

### 4. Data Freshness

| Metric | Definition | Measurement Method | Target |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| Write-to-query latency | Time from NFS/SMB write to S3 AP query visibility | Write file via NFS, immediately query via S3 AP | Near-zero (same volume, same data) |
| Catalog refresh latency | Time from file creation to Glue Catalog awareness | Glue Crawler run time or event-driven update | < 5 minutes (crawler) or < 1 minute (event) |

**Key advantage**: Since S3 Access Points read directly from the FSx volume, data written via NFS/SMB is immediately visible via S3 API. No sync delay.

### 5. Data Copies Avoided

| Metric | Definition | Measurement Method | Target |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| Copy count reduction | Number of redundant data copies eliminated | Inventory of current data copies vs. new architecture | ≥ 50% reduction |
| Storage savings | TB of duplicate storage eliminated | Sum of eliminated copy sizes | Quantify in $/month |
| Pipeline elimination | Number of sync/copy pipelines removed | Count of ETL jobs no longer needed | ≥ 1 pipeline eliminated |

### 6. Recovery Time Objective (RTO) / Recovery Point Objective (RPO)

| Metric | Definition | Measurement Method | Target |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| Snapshot RTO | Time to restore volume from snapshot | Timed snapshot restore test | < 5 minutes |
| Snapshot RPO | Maximum data loss window | Snapshot schedule frequency | ≤ 1 hour (hourly snapshots) |
| SnapMirror RTO | Time to failover to DR region | Timed failover test | < 15 minutes |
| SnapMirror RPO | Replication lag | SnapMirror lag metric | < 15 minutes (async) or 0 (sync) |

### 7. Access Policy Review Time

| Metric | Definition | Measurement Method | Target |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| Policy audit time | Time to review and validate all access policies | Manual review of IAM + AP + file system permissions | < 1 hour per access point |
| Permission change time | Time to grant/revoke access | Time from request to effective change | < 30 minutes |
| Compliance report generation | Time to produce access audit report | CloudTrail query + report generation | < 1 hour |

## PoC Success Criteria Template

### Phase 1: Connectivity Validation (Week 1)

| Criterion | Pass Condition | Test Method |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| S3 AP creation | Access point in AVAILABLE state | `aws fsx describe-s3-access-points` |

---

## Business KPI Mapping

Technical KPIs must be translated into business/operational metrics that executives and business stakeholders can evaluate.

| Technical KPI | Business KPI | Business Question Answered |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| Query latency (seconds) | Time from analysis request to decision | "How fast can we act on data?" |
| Data freshness (write-to-query) | Operational data reflection delay | "Are we making decisions on current data?" |
| Data copies avoided (count) | Storage cost reduction ($/month) + operational headcount savings | "How much are we saving by not maintaining copy pipelines?" |
| Throughput (MB/s) | Analyst productivity (queries/day) | "Can our team run all needed analyses without waiting?" |
| Cost per TB scanned | Analytics cost per business insight | "What does each report/dashboard cost us?" |
| RTO / RPO | Business continuity SLA compliance | "Can we meet our regulatory recovery commitments?" |
| Access policy review time | Audit response time (hours) | "How quickly can we respond to a compliance audit?" |
| RAG response accuracy | Knowledge worker time savings | "How much faster can employees find information?" |

### Executive Dashboard Metrics

For CxO reporting, distill to 4-5 headline metrics:

1. **Cost avoidance**: $X/month saved by eliminating data copy pipelines
2. **Time-to-insight**: Reduced from Y days to Z hours
3. **Compliance posture**: 100% of data access auditable via CloudTrail
4. **AI readiness**: N documents accessible for AI/RAG without migration
5. **Operational risk**: DR tested, RTO < 15 min, RPO < 1 hour

---

## Initial Use Case Selection

For the first Investment Case, select ONE use case that minimizes risk while maximizing measurability.

### Decision: Enterprise IT RAG

Based on the selection matrix below, **Enterprise IT RAG** is the recommended first use case.

```yaml
# Value Hypothesis (define BEFORE verification)
value_hypothesis:
  use_case: "Enterprise IT RAG"
  business_issue: "Incident responders spend too long searching for relevant runbooks and past incident reports"
  target_users: "L2 support engineers, SRE team, operations staff"
  data_source: "Runbooks, incident reports, architecture docs, FAQs on NFS/SMB file shares"
  
  expected_value:
    search_time_reduction: "30-50%"
    first_response_time_reduction: "20-30%"
    mttr_improvement: "10-15%"
  
  measurement:
    baseline_period: "30 days before PoC"
    measurement_period: "90 days"
    primary_kpi: "Mean time from incident start to relevant document found"
    secondary_kpis:
      - "MTTR (mean time to resolution)"
      - "User satisfaction (1-5 survey)"
      - "RAG answer accuracy (human review pass rate)"
  
  guardrails:
    data_risk: "Low (no PHI/PII in IT runbooks)"
    read_only: true
    human_review: "Required for first 30 days; optional after accuracy > 90%"
  
  decision_criteria:
    scale: "Search time reduced ≥ 30%; accuracy ≥ 85%; cost within budget"
    adjust: "Technically works but adoption < 50% or accuracy < 85%"
    stop: "No measurable improvement after 60 days"
  
  investment_case_timeline:
    benchmark_complete: "Week 2"
    security_test_complete: "Week 2"
    initial_cost_estimate: "Week 3"
    draft_investment_case: "Day 30 (based on initial usage data)"
    final_investment_case: "Day 90 (based on full measurement period)"
```

### Measurement Sequence

| Step | Activity | Timeline | Output |
|------|----------|----------|--------|
| 1 | Baseline KPI measurement (current search time, MTTR) | Week -2 to 0 | Baseline metrics |
| 2 | Data readiness assessment | Week 1 | Readiness score |
| 3 | FSx S3 AP + Athena/Bedrock deployment | Week 1-2 | Working environment |
| 4 | Functional + Security + Benchmark tests | Week 2 | Evidence records |
| 5 | User pilot (5-10 users) | Week 3-4 | Initial usage data |
| 6 | 30-day review + draft Investment Case | Day 30 | Go/Adjust decision |
| 7 | Full user rollout (if Go) | Day 30-60 | Broader adoption data |
| 8 | 60-day optimization | Day 60 | Tuned system |
| 9 | 90-day Scale/Adjust/Stop decision | Day 90 | Final Investment Case |

### Recommended First Use Case

| Criterion | Enterprise IT RAG | Manufacturing Maintenance | Healthcare Research |
|-----------|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| PHI/PII risk | Low | Low | Medium (requires de-identification) |
| Business KPI clarity | High (MTTR) | High (downtime) | Medium (research output) |
| 30/60/90 day measurability | High | High | Medium |
| Data readiness (typical) | High (docs on NAS) | Medium (mixed formats) | Low (requires pipeline) |
| Stakeholder complexity | Low | Low | High (IRB, ethics) |
| **Recommended priority** | **#1** | **#2** | **#3** |

**Recommendation**: Start with Enterprise IT RAG or Manufacturing Maintenance. Healthcare should follow after the governance framework is validated with a lower-risk use case.

### Executive Investment Case Input Requirements

Before creating an Investment Case, gather these measured values:

| Input | Source | Required For |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Query latency (P50, P95) | Benchmark results | Time-to-insight claim |
| Throughput (MB/s) | Benchmark results | Capacity planning |
| Dataset size and file count | Data readiness assessment | Storage cost projection |
| Storage + query + ingestion cost | AWS Cost Explorer + Athena billing | ROI calculation |
| Operational effort (hours/week) | Operations team estimate | TCO comparison |
| Data freshness (write-to-query) | Functional test | Freshness SLA claim |
| Error/failure rate | Test results | Reliability claim |
| Security test results | Negative test matrix | Risk posture statement |

### 90-Day Decision Criteria

At Day 90, make one of three decisions:

| Decision | Criteria | Next Action |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| **Scale** | KPI improvement confirmed (≥ target); risk and cost within acceptable range; user adoption > 50% | Expand to more users/data/use cases; present to executive for investment |
| **Adjust** | Technically feasible but data quality, user adoption, or business fit needs work | Identify specific gaps; define 30-day improvement plan; re-evaluate at Day 120 |
| **Stop** | KPI improvement not achievable; operational burden too high; risk unacceptable; cost exceeds value | Document learnings; archive environment; redirect investment |

---

## PoC Guardrails

Define clear boundaries for what is allowed during PoC to enable safe experimentation.

### What IS Allowed in PoC

| Activity | Condition |
|----------|-----------|
| Read-only analytics (Athena, Glue Crawler) | Any data classification |
| Glue ETL read + write-back (Parquet) | Internal/Public data only |
| Bedrock RAG ingestion | De-identified documents only |
| Performance benchmarking | Synthetic or public datasets |
| Security testing (IAM deny verification) | Controlled test principals |
| Snapshot restore testing | Non-production volume |

### What is NOT Allowed in PoC

| Activity | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| Delta Lake write / MERGE / compaction | Not Supported — will produce inconsistent state |
| Real PHI/PII in non-production environments | Compliance violation risk |
| Internet-origin AP for Confidential/Regulated data | Security posture insufficient for regulated data |
| Modifying production AP policies for testing | Risk of production access disruption |
| Exceeding defined cost ceiling | Budget control |
| Sharing PoC access credentials | Audit trail integrity |

### PoC Cost Ceiling

Define maximum acceptable PoC cost before starting:

| Component | Estimated Cost (2-week PoC) |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| FSx for ONTAP (512 MB/s, 1 TB SSD) | ~$800 |
| Athena queries (10 TB scanned) | ~$50 |
| Glue Crawler + ETL | ~$20 |
| CloudTrail (S3 data events) | ~$10 |
| **Total ceiling** | **< $1,000** |

### PoC Exit Criteria

| Outcome | Action |
|---------|--------|
| All Phase 1-2 criteria pass | Proceed to Phase 3 (production readiness) |
| Performance targets not met | Evaluate FSx throughput sizing; re-test with higher provisioning |
| Security verification fails | Investigate and remediate before proceeding |
| Cost exceeds ceiling | Stop and reassess architecture |
| Fundamental limitation discovered | Document and evaluate alternative approaches |

## RAG Use Case Catalog

FSx S3 AP + Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases enables RAG on existing enterprise file data without migration.

| Industry | Use Case | Source Documents | Business Value |
|----------|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Manufacturing** | Maintenance manual / work standard search | PDF manuals, work instructions, inspection records | Reduce equipment downtime; faster technician onboarding |
| **Healthcare** | Research document / de-identified case search | Research papers, de-identified clinical notes, protocols | Accelerate research; improve evidence-based decisions |
| **Financial Services** | Regulation / audit trail / contract search | Compliance documents, audit reports, contracts | Faster regulatory response; reduce compliance risk |
| **Media** | Past asset / metadata / script search | Production notes, scripts, asset metadata files | Faster content discovery; reduce re-creation of existing assets |
| **Enterprise IT** | Incident report / runbook search | Incident reports, runbooks, architecture documents | Faster incident resolution; knowledge preservation |

### RAG Implementation Pattern

```
Existing NFS/SMB workflow          Analytics / AI workflow
        │                                    │
        ▼                                    ▼
┌──────────────────┐              ┌─────────────────────┐
│ Users write docs │              │ Bedrock Knowledge   │
│ via NFS/SMB      │              │ Base ingests via     │
│ (unchanged)      │              │ S3 Access Point      │
└────────┬─────────┘              └──────────┬──────────┘
         │                                    │
         ▼                                    ▼
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              FSx for ONTAP Volume                     │
│         (single source of truth)                      │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key advantage**: Documents written by users via NFS/SMB are immediately available for RAG ingestion via S3 AP. No copy, no sync, no delay.

## Future: Agentic AI Integration

As AI evolves from RAG to autonomous agents, FSx S3 AP positions enterprise file data as a governed data access layer for AI agents.

### Potential Integration Points

| AI Capability | FSx S3 AP Role | Status |
|--------------|---------------|--------|
| **Bedrock Knowledge Bases (RAG)** | Document data source for retrieval | ✅ Available ([tutorial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/tutorial-build-rag-with-bedrock.html)) |
| **Bedrock Agents (tool use)** | Agent retrieves documents via S3 API tool | Architecturally feasible (agent → S3 GetObject → AP → FSx) |
| **MCP-compatible tools** | S3-based document retrieval tool for any MCP client | Architecturally feasible (MCP tool wraps S3 GetObject) |
| **Athena query tool** | Agent runs SQL on file data via Athena + Glue Catalog | Architecturally feasible (agent → Athena → Glue → AP → FSx) |
| **Multi-modal AI** | Image/video/audio analysis on media files | Architecturally feasible (agent → GetObject → media file → model) |

### Governance for Agentic AI

When AI agents access enterprise data autonomously, governance becomes critical:

- **Read-only access points**: Agents should NEVER have write access to source data
- **Scoped IAM roles**: Per-agent IAM roles with minimum necessary permissions
- **Audit trail**: All agent data access logged via CloudTrail S3 data events
- **Human-in-the-loop**: Agent actions that affect business decisions require human approval
- **Rate limiting**: Prevent runaway agents from overwhelming FSx throughput
- **Data classification awareness**: Agents must respect data classification boundaries

### Strategic Positioning

```
Today (2025):          Near-term (2026):           Future:
RAG on documents  →    Agents query structured  →  Autonomous agents
(Bedrock KB)           + unstructured data          with governed access
                       (Athena + Bedrock)           to enterprise files
```

FSx S3 AP provides a **governed, auditable, read-only data access layer** that is well-suited for AI agent architectures where data security and auditability are non-negotiable.

### Agentic AI Roadmap (Phased)

| Phase | Capability | Business Use Case | Guardrails | Human Approval | Exit Criteria |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| **1. Read-only RAG** | Bedrock Knowledge Base on FSx documents | Document search, Q&A on manuals/policies | Read-only AP, human review of answers | Required for all responses | Accuracy > 80%, user adoption > 50% |
| **2. RAG + Query Assistant** | RAG + Athena SQL generation | "Show me last month's production data" → SQL → results | Read-only AP + Athena, query cost limits | Required for data-modifying queries | Query accuracy > 90%, cost < budget |
| **3. Agent-Assisted Analysis** | Multi-step: retrieve docs → query data → summarize | Automated report generation, trend analysis | Read-only AP, execution time limits, output review | Required before report distribution | Report quality validated by domain expert |
| **4. Multi-Tool Governed Agent** | Agent uses multiple tools (S3, Athena, Bedrock, Lambda) | Complex research workflows, cross-source analysis | Per-tool IAM scoping, rate limiting, audit | Required for actions with business impact | Workflow completion rate > 95% |
| **5. Human-Approved Autonomous** | Agent proposes actions, human approves execution | Automated data pipeline management, anomaly response | Full audit trail, rollback capability, SLA monitoring | Approval for irreversible actions only | Mean time to resolution improved by > 50% |

## Data Readiness Assessment

Before deploying FSx S3 AP for analytics or AI, assess whether the data is ready.

### Assessment Dimensions

| Dimension | Question | Score (1-5) | Action if Low |
|-----------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **File format readiness** | Are files in analytics-friendly formats (Parquet, ORC, JSON, CSV)? | | Convert to Parquet for best performance |
| **Metadata availability** | Do files have consistent naming, partitioning, or metadata? | | Implement naming conventions; add Glue Crawler |
| **Access ownership** | Is there a clear data owner who can approve analytics access? | | Identify and document data owner |
| **Data classification** | Is data classified (Public/Internal/Confidential/Regulated)? | | Classify before exposing via S3 AP |
| **Freshness** | How current is the data? Is staleness acceptable for analytics? | | Document freshness SLA |
| **Duplicate data** | Are there redundant copies that could be consolidated? | | Inventory copies; plan consolidation |
| **Sensitive data ratio** | What percentage contains PHI/PII/secrets? | | De-identification pipeline if > 0% for analytics |
| **Searchability** | Can documents be meaningfully searched/chunked for RAG? | | Evaluate document structure; test chunking |
| **Catalog readiness** | Can a Glue Crawler successfully catalog the data? | | Test crawler; fix format issues |
| **Volume size** | Is the dataset size appropriate for FSx throughput provisioning? | | Size FSx throughput to dataset |

### Readiness Scoring

| Total Score | Readiness Level | Recommendation |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| 40-50 | Ready | Proceed to PoC immediately |
| 30-39 | Mostly ready | Address 1-2 gaps, then PoC |
| 20-29 | Partially ready | Significant preparation needed (2-4 weeks) |
| 10-19 | Not ready | Major data engineering effort required first |

### Assessment Output

```yaml
assessment_date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
assessor: "<name>"
data_source: "<volume/path>"
total_score: X/50
readiness_level: "Ready | Mostly ready | Partially ready | Not ready"
blockers:
  - "<blocker 1>"
  - "<blocker 2>"
recommended_actions:
  - action: "<action>"
    effort: "<days>"
    owner: "<team>"
poc_ready: true/false
estimated_prep_time: "X weeks"
```

## Use Case KPI Tree

For each use case, define the full chain from business issue to measurable target.

### Enterprise IT: Runbook RAG

| Level | Metric | Measurement | Target |
|-------|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Business issue** | Incident resolution takes too long | MTTR from ticket system | Baseline: X hours |
| **Process KPI** | Runbook/procedure search time | Time from search start to relevant document found | Reduce by 50% in 90 days |

## 30/60/90 Day Value Realization Plan

### Day 30: Adoption & Baseline

| Check | Question | Evidence | Decision |
|-------|----------|----------|----------|
| Usage adoption | Are target users actively querying? | Query count, unique users | If < 50% adoption: investigate barriers |
| KPI baseline | Do we have reliable baseline measurements? | Before/after comparison data | If no baseline: extend measurement period |
| Major issues | Any blocking technical or security issues? | Issue tracker, incident log | If critical issues: pause and remediate |
| User feedback | What do users say about the experience? | Survey, interviews | Incorporate feedback into optimization |

**30-Day Decision**: Continue as planned / Adjust scope / Escalate issues

### Day 60: Optimization & Evidence

| Check | Question | Evidence | Decision |
|-------|----------|----------|----------|
| Performance trend | Is query performance stable or improving? | P50/P95 latency trend | If degrading: investigate and tune |
| Cost tracking | Is actual cost within projected budget? | Cost Explorer data | If over budget: optimize or resize |
| Process improvement | Is there measurable time/effort savings? | Before/after process metrics | If no improvement: reassess use case fit |
| User feedback incorporation | Were Day 30 feedback items addressed? | Change log | If not: prioritize |

**60-Day Decision**: Optimize and continue / Scale to more users / Pivot approach

### Day 90: Value Report & Scale Decision

| Check | Question | Evidence | Decision |
|-------|----------|----------|----------|
| Business value | Can we quantify $ or time saved? | KPI dashboard, cost comparison | If positive: present to executive sponsor |
| Scale readiness | Can we expand to more data/users/use cases? | Capacity assessment, user demand | If ready: plan expansion |
| Operational maturity | Are runbooks tested, monitoring stable? | Ops metrics, incident history | If mature: hand to BAU operations |
| Executive report | Is there a compelling story for leadership? | Monthly value report | Present and get expansion approval |

**90-Day Decision**: Scale / Maintain / Sunset

## Organization Adoption Model

Successful deployment requires organizational alignment, not just technology.

### Roles and Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility | Engagement Level |
|------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Executive Sponsor** | Budget approval, organizational priority, blocker removal | Monthly review |
| **Business Owner** | Define use case, success criteria, user acceptance | Weekly check-in |
| **Data Owner** | Approve data access, classification, retention | Per-project approval |
| **Platform Team** | Deploy, operate, monitor FSx + S3 AP + analytics | Daily operations |
| **Security / Governance** | Review policies, approve access, audit | Per-change review |
| **AI Product Owner** | Define RAG use cases, evaluate accuracy, manage guardrails | Weekly iteration |
| **User Champion** | Drive adoption within business unit, collect feedback | Continuous |
| **Feedback Community** | Provide usage feedback, report issues, suggest improvements | Ongoing |

### Adoption Stages

```
Stage 1: Pilot (1 team, 1 use case)
  → Prove value with minimal risk
  → 1-2 months

Stage 2: Expand (multiple teams, same use case)
  → Scale proven pattern
  → 2-3 months

Stage 3: Diversify (multiple use cases)
  → Add RAG, new data sources, new analytics
  → 3-6 months

Stage 4: Standardize (organization-wide platform)
  → Self-service, governance automated, value tracked
  → 6-12 months
```

## Agentic AI Do-Not-Automate Rules

As AI agents gain capabilities, explicitly define what must NEVER be automated without human approval.

| Rule | Rationale | Enforcement |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| **Never** delete or modify production data autonomously | Irreversible; data loss risk | Read-only AP for agents; no DeleteObject/PutObject in agent IAM |
| **Never** change access policies without human approval | Security posture change | SCP restricts PutAccessPointPolicy to admin roles only |
| **Never** execute clinical or financial decisions autonomously | Regulatory and safety risk | Human-in-the-loop mandatory for all decision outputs |
| **Never** export regulated data outside approved boundary | Compliance violation | VPC-origin AP; no cross-region/cross-account without approval |
| **Never** trigger irreversible workflows without approval | Cannot undo | Agent proposes action; human approves execution |
| **Never** bypass audit logging | Compliance requirement | CloudTrail cannot be disabled by agent IAM role |
| **Never** access data above agent's classification level | Data governance | Per-agent IAM scoped to specific AP and prefix |
| **Never** exceed defined cost/throughput limits | Budget control | Service quotas and CloudWatch alarms on agent activity |

### Enforcement Mechanisms

| Mechanism | What it Prevents |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Read-only file system user on AP | Agent cannot write/delete data |
| Scoped IAM role (GetObject + ListBucket only) | Agent cannot modify policies or infrastructure |
| SCP on agent account/OU | Agent cannot escalate privileges |
| CloudWatch alarm on throughput | Runaway agent detected and throttled |
| Bedrock guardrails | Inappropriate content filtered |
| Human approval gate | Irreversible actions require explicit approval |
