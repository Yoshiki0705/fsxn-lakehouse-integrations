## Integration Pattern Details

### 1. S3 Vectors × Permission-aware RAG (Already Implemented)

**Status**: ✅ Implemented in `FSx-for-ONTAP-Agentic-Access-Aware-RAG` repository

**Artifacts**:
- `docs/s3-vectors-sid-architecture-guide.md` (JA/EN, architecture guide)
- `bin/demo-app.ts` (CDK stack, includes S3 Vectors path)
- `stack-architecture-comparison.md` (OpenSearch Serverless vs S3 Vectors comparison)

**Background**: Amazon S3 Vectors reached GA (re:Invent 2025-12). 90% cost reduction vs dedicated vector DBs, 2 billion vectors/index, ap-northeast-1 available.

**Integration design**:

```
FSx for ONTAP (documents)
       │
       ▼ S3 Access Point
Bedrock Embedding Model
       │
       ▼
Amazon S3 Vectors
(vectors stored with ACL metadata)
       │
       ├── metadata: {owner, group, acl_hash, svm, volume, source_path}
       │
       ▼ Metadata-filtered search
Permission-aware Retrieval
       │
       ▼
Bedrock FM (response generation)
```

**Primary owner**: `FSx-for-ONTAP-Agentic-Access-Aware-RAG` — add S3 Vectors alternative path alongside existing OpenSearch Serverless

**This repo's role**: Add S3 Vectors as vector store candidate in manufacturing data platform "vector store selection" section with cost comparison

**OpenSearch Serverless vs S3 Vectors selection criteria**:

| Dimension | OpenSearch Serverless | S3 Vectors |
|-----------|----------------------|------------|
| Filtering | Complex metadata filters + boolean operations | Basic metadata filtering |
| Cost | OCU-based (minimum 2 OCU ≈ $700/month) | Storage + query (pay-per-use) |
| Scale | Large (billions of vectors) | 2B/index (GA) |
| Latency | 10-100ms | Sub-100ms |
| Bedrock KB integration | Native support | Managed KB support (to confirm) |
| Best for | Advanced filters, hybrid search, k-NN + BM25 | Cost-sensitive, simple ACL filters, large vector volumes |

### 2. Bedrock Managed KB × Omnigent Polly

**Background**: Bedrock Managed Knowledge Base (GA 2026-06-17) includes Agentic Retriever, integrated with AgentCore Gateway via MCP.

**Integration design**:

```
Omnigent (multi-agent orchestration)
       │
       ├── Polly (multi-agent coding)
       │
       ├── Quality Supervisor Agent
       │        │
       │        ▼
       │   Bedrock Managed KB (Agentic Retriever)
       │        │
       │        ├── S3 connector → FSx for ONTAP S3 AP
       │        ├── Smart Parsing (PDF/Office/tables)
       │        └── Multi-step retrieval
       │
       └── AgentCore Gateway (MCP)
                │
                ├── Unity AI Gateway (Databricks governance)
                └── AWS Context (discovery)
```

**Primary owner**: This repository (within Omnigent evaluation document)
**Linked**: Upgrade Bedrock KB pattern in `FSx-for-ONTAP-Agentic-Access-Aware-RAG` to Managed KB

## Edge → Cloud Integration: ontap-edge-to-cloud-ai Touchpoints

The `ontap-edge-to-cloud-ai` repository provides patterns for aggregating edge device data into ONTAP and connecting to AWS AI/Analytics via S3 AP. Integration with this repository's manufacturing data platform:

| This Repo Feature | ontap-edge-to-cloud-ai Counterpart |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Layer 1 edge data ingestion | Edge device → ONTAP aggregation patterns |
| Kafka → local ClickHouse | Edge-side streaming design |
| S3 AP → Bedrock/Athena | Aggregated data analytics path |
| AWS Context auto-catalog | Edge data automatic discovery |

### Databricks Integration Paths (edge-to-cloud-ai side)

> Sync source: `ontap-edge-to-cloud-ai/docs/en/databricks-integration.md` (updated 2026-06-18)

| Path | Route | Latency | Status |
|------|-------|---------|--------|
| A | Kafka → Structured Streaming → Delta | Seconds–minutes | ✅ Validated |
| B | S3 AP → Auto Loader → Delta | Minutes | ✅ Validated |
| C | ONTAP S3 → External Location → Unity Catalog | — | Designed |
| **D** | **Kafka → Lakebase (LTAP)** | **Milliseconds–seconds (estimated)** | **🆕 Under design review (added 2026-06-18)** |

> **Path A improvement (added 2026-06-18)**: Lakeflow Real-Time Mode (Spark Declarative Pipelines, Public Preview, DBR 18.1.3) may reduce Path A's Structured Streaming latency (seconds–minutes) to ~5ms. This is an improvement to the existing Path A via a trigger-mode change, not a new path. Production adoption decision after GA. See [Lakeflow Evaluation](#lakeflow-evaluation-zerobus-ingest--real-time-mode-dais-2026--synced-2026-06-18) below.

### Path D: Kafka → Lakebase (LTAP) — Details

**Sync status**: Under design review (added 2026-06-18). Added to `ontap-edge-to-cloud-ai` in `docs/en/databricks-integration.md` Section 2.5 and `.kiro/specs/edge-to-cloud-poc/design.md` Section 4.5.

**Data flow**:

```
Edge ONTAP
    │ Kafka Producer (v3 event schema)
    ▼
Kafka (MSK / Confluent)
    │
    ├── Path A: Structured Streaming → Delta (existing)
    │
    └── Path D: Kafka → Lakebase (LTAP) [future candidate]
              │
              ├── Operational DB + analytics unification
              ├── Real-time quality decision API
              └── Lakebase Search (vector + full-text)
```

**LTAP components** (evidence tier: **Public**, DAIS 2026-06-16):

| Component | Role | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Lakebase | Postgres-compatible operational DB | GA |
| Lakehouse//RT | Millisecond queries (Reyden engine) | Preview |
| Lakebase Search | Hybrid vector + full-text | Beta |

**Relationship with existing paths**: Path D is a **parallel option (alternative candidate), not a replacement** for Path A. Edge-side design (local ONTAP + Kafka topic design) is unchanged.

**Adoption gate conditions**:
1. Kafka → Lakebase connector documentation published
2. Lakehouse//RT reaches GA
3. Latency / Operational AI requirements materialize that existing Path A cannot satisfy

**Related documentation**: Detailed LTAP analysis in this repository is at [14_realtime_analytics_landscape.md](../../integrations/manufacturing-data-platform/docs/en/14_realtime_analytics_landscape.md), section "LTAP (Lake Transactional/Analytical Processing)".

### Lakeflow Evaluation: Zerobus Ingest / Real-Time Mode (DAIS 2026 — synced 2026-06-18)

> Sync source: `ontap-edge-to-cloud-ai/docs/en/databricks-integration.md` Section 2.6 (added 2026-06-18). Records the evaluation of the DAIS 2026 (2026-06-16) Lakeflow announcements in the context of the edge → cloud streaming design.

The Lakeflow-related features announced at DAIS 2026 were evaluated in the context of this ecosystem's streaming design (Paths A–D). All are positioned as **additional options to choose based on use case**, not replacements for the existing Kafka event bus design.

| Feature | Status | Position in this ecosystem |
|---------|--------|----------------------------|
| Zerobus Ingest | GA | **Additional option** for Databricks-only ingestion. Writes directly to Delta bypassing Kafka, but is not a Kafka replacement (see "Key Design Decisions" below) |
| Real-Time Mode (Spark Declarative Pipelines) | Public Preview (DBR 18.1.3) | **Path A latency improvement path**. May reduce Structured Streaming's seconds–minutes to ~5ms |
| Lakeflow Connect (100+ connectors) | GA (connector-dependent) | Managed connector suite. ONTAP/NFS direct connector availability to be confirmed |
| Agentic Data Engineering | Preview | Touchpoint of data quality × agents. Awaiting API availability |

#### Key Design Decisions

- **Kafka continues as a general-purpose event bus**: This ecosystem's Kafka fans out to multiple consumers (ClickHouse, Lambda, Databricks). Zerobus Ingest is an ingestion interface to a single Databricks sink and is not a replacement for the Kafka fan-out role. Zerobus is treated as "an additional route when a Databricks-only ingestion need materializes."
- **Real-Time Mode is a Path A improvement**: Real-Time Mode is not a new path but a latency improvement to the existing Path A (Kafka → Structured Streaming → Delta) via a trigger-mode change. Evaluate after GA, if a Path A latency requirement materializes. It may cover some Path D (Lakebase/LTAP) use cases (millisecond latency).
- **No edge-side changes**: The Kafka Producer design (v3 event schema, topic design) is unchanged. The impact is limited to cloud-side reception/ingestion.
- **No on-premises support**: Lakeflow is a Databricks-managed feature with no on-premises/edge deployment option. Edge-layer real-time analytics (ClickHouse, etc.) remains necessary.

#### Path Relationship

```
Kafka (general event bus, multiple consumers)
 ├── Path A current (Structured Streaming, sec–min) ✅ Validated
 │     └── Path A improved (Real-Time Mode, ~5ms) 🆕 Under evaluation (Public Preview)
 ├── Path D future (Lakebase/LTAP, ms–sec) 🔄 Under design review
 └── (other consumers: ClickHouse, Lambda)

Zerobus Ingest → Delta direct (Kafka bypass, Databricks-only) 🆕 Under evaluation (GA)
```

#### Adoption Gate Conditions

| Feature | Gate condition |
|---------|----------------|
| Zerobus Ingest | A Databricks-only ingestion need materializes and a use case without Kafka fan-out is identified |
| Real-Time Mode | Reaches GA + a latency requirement materializes that existing Path A cannot satisfy (production decision after GA) |
| Lakeflow Connect | ONTAP/NFS direct connector published |
| Agentic Data Engineering | API published + a data quality workflow use case identified |

> **How to choose (use-case-based)**: Use the Kafka event bus when general fan-out to multiple consumers is required; Zerobus Ingest for low-ops ingestion to a single Databricks sink; Real-Time Mode to reduce existing Path A latency — select per requirement. None are mutually exclusive; they can be combined.

> See also the DAIS 2026 note in [14_realtime_analytics_landscape.md](../../integrations/manufacturing-data-platform/docs/en/14_realtime_analytics_landscape.md). Note that Lakehouse//RT (query engine) and Real-Time Mode (Structured Streaming latency improvement) are distinct features.

### Cross-Repository Validation Items (LTAP Path)

| Validation Item | Description | Owner | Status |
|----------------|-------------|-------|--------|
| Kafka → Lakebase connector | Connector specification, configuration, Kafka topic → table mapping | edge repo + this repo | 🔲 Spec not published |
| Ordering guarantees | Whether Kafka **intra-partition** ordering is preserved in Lakebase writes (cross-partition ordering is not guaranteed by Kafka design — out of scope) | edge repo | 🔲 Not validated |
| Failure behavior | Kafka offset management on Lakebase write failure, retry, DLQ. Future design consideration: DLQ message replay procedure (timing, trigger, re-injection method) | edge repo | 🔲 Not validated |
| Schema compatibility | v3 event schema (JSON) → Lakebase table schema mapping | both repos | 🔲 Design pending |
| Write → query latency | Time from Lakebase write to query availability (including via Lakehouse//RT) | this repo | 🔲 After Lakehouse//RT Preview validation |
| ACL integration | Whether Lakebase tables can hold FSx for ONTAP-derived ACL metadata | this repo | 🔲 Design pending |
| Lakebase ap-northeast-1 availability | Confirm Lakebase GA is not region-limited; verify availability in ap-northeast-1 | this repo | 🔲 Not confirmed |
| Lakebase Private Link connectivity | Whether Private Link (port 5432) is available for Lakebase access from VPC (announced GA at DAIS 2026) | this repo | 🔲 Confirm ap-northeast-1 availability |
| Zerobus Ingest alternative path | Whether Zerobus Ingest (Private Link supported) can write directly to Lakebase as Kafka alternative. Prerequisite: confirm whether external sources (MSK/Kafka Producer) can push to Zerobus Ingest endpoint | edge repo | 🔲 Spec confirmation pending |
| Real-Time Mode GA evaluation | After Real-Time Mode (Spark Declarative Pipelines, DBR 18.1.3) reaches GA, evaluate Path A latency improvement (sec–min → ~5ms). Verify whether it applies to existing Path A via trigger-mode change alone, and whether it can cover some Path D (Lakebase/LTAP) use cases | edge repo + this repo | 🔲 Public Preview (evaluate after GA) |
| Zerobus Ingest SDK validation (gRPC/Python) | Validate Zerobus Ingest SDK (gRPC / Python) direct Delta writes. Confirm push method from external sources, throughput, Private Link route, and schema definition method | edge repo | 🔲 Awaiting SDK validation |

> ⚠️ **Validation Required**: The Kafka → Lakebase direct write path has no published connector specification. Do not make PoC adoption decisions until all validation items above are confirmed.

**Future integration**: Validate LTAP (Kafka → Lakebase) path integrated with `ontap-edge-to-cloud-ai` edge → cloud flows. Re-evaluate at Lakehouse//RT GA.
