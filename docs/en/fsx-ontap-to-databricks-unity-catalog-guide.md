## Executive Summary

**Q: Can FSx for ONTAP data be used as a Databricks Unity Catalog data source?**

**A: Yes. However, not via direct External Location registration — indirect paths are required.**

| Conclusion | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| ✅ Usable | Multiple paths exist to bring FSx for ONTAP data under UC governance |
| ❌ Zero-copy direct connection not supported | UC External Location does **not support** S3 AP / ONTAP S3 / NFS mount |
| ✅ Recommended paths available | DataSync → S3 → UC tables, Kafka → Structured Streaming → UC Delta |
| ⚠️ DAIS 2026 features do not directly resolve this | OpenSharing / Delta Sharing are sharing protocols, not storage connectors |

### Why FSx for ONTAP (Multi-Protocol Value)

The core value of FSx for ONTAP is that **the same data is simultaneously accessible via NFS / SMB / S3 AP**. While Databricks requires an indirect path, understand the overall positioning:

```
Same data (FSx for ONTAP volume)
  │
  ├── NFS → Data scientists (Linux workstations)
  ├── SMB → Business users (Windows file shares)
  ├── S3 AP → AWS services (Athena, Glue, EMR, Bedrock, Snowflake)
  │
  └── DataSync / FPolicy → S3 → Databricks UC
       (analytics copy under UC governance)
```

Data that business users access daily via NFS/SMB can be used **without conversion** by AWS analytics services (Athena, Glue, EMR) via S3 AP. For Databricks UC, an indirect path is required, but by syncing an **analytics copy** via DataSync, full UC governance (lineage, tags, masks, row filters) can be applied.

## Common Misconceptions and FAQ

### Q1: Can OpenSharing connect directly to FSx for ONTAP?

**A: No. OpenSharing is a "sharing protocol", not a "storage connector".**

OpenSharing (successor to Delta Sharing, announced at DAIS 2026) provides:
- Cross-organization sharing of data, models, and agent skills
- Apache Iceberg IRC client support
- Zero-copy **sharing** (granting read access from provider's storage to recipients)

However, OpenSharing:
- ❌ Does **not** register FSx for ONTAP as UC storage
- ❌ Does **not** make S3-compatible endpoints recognized as UC External Locations
- ❌ Does **not** connect NFS/SMB file systems to UC

What OpenSharing can do (FSx for ONTAP related):
- ✅ After FSx for ONTAP data is ingested to S3 and converted to Delta tables, share those tables via OpenSharing to other organizations

```
FSx for ONTAP → [DataSync/ETL] → S3 → UC Delta table → OpenSharing → recipient
                                                          ↑ OpenSharing scope is here
```

### Q2: Can Delta Sharing directly share FSx for ONTAP files?

**A: No. Delta Sharing is a "table sharing protocol", not a mechanism for sharing arbitrary files without transformation.**

Delta Sharing prerequisites:
- Shared assets must be **Delta tables** (or Iceberg tables)
- Table data must reside on **UC-recognized storage** (standard S3 / ADLS / GCS)
- There is **no capability** to share files on FSx for ONTAP (CSV, images, PDFs) directly via Delta Sharing without prior conversion

To share FSx for ONTAP data via Delta Sharing:
1. Ingest from FSx for ONTAP → S3
2. Register as a Delta table on S3
3. Share via Delta Sharing

### Q3: Can't Databricks NFS-mount FSx for ONTAP?

**A: Databricks runtime seccomp policies block kernel NFS mounts.**

- Databricks serverless and shared clusters restrict `mount` system calls for security
- Even dedicated clusters (Classic) cannot NFS-mount due to runtime boundaries (verified)
- FUSE-based mounts (`s3fs-fuse`, etc.) are similarly restricted

### Q4: Can't I register FSx for ONTAP S3 Access Points as a UC External Location?

**A: As of May 2026, Databricks does not officially support S3 Access Points for UC External Locations.**

Verification results (this repository, Databricks Support confirmed 2026-05-26):
- The `access_point` field was never GA-released and has been removed from documentation
- Partial operations (top-level listing, explicit file reads) are "a side effect of incomplete internal handling, not a supported code path" (Databricks Support response)
- CREATE TABLE, subdirectory listing return `AccessDenied` / `UC_CLOUD_STORAGE_ACCESS_FAILURE`

### Q5: Can't ONTAP S3 (S3-compatible endpoint) be registered with UC?

**A: UC External Location supports only the following:**

| Supported Storage | Status |
|-------------------|--------|
| Amazon S3 (native) | ✅ |
| Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 | ✅ |
| Google Cloud Storage | ✅ |
| Cloudflare R2 | ✅ |
| S3-compatible endpoints (MinIO, ONTAP S3, etc.) | ❌ Not supported |

ONTAP S3 is S3 API-compatible, but UC's session policy generation logic only handles standard S3 bucket ARNs.

### Q6: Can't the Volumes connector (OpenSharing) share unstructured data?

**A: As of June 2026, while the Volumes connector is designed as an OpenSharing Agent Asset type, there is no capability to register FSx for ONTAP directly as a UC Volume.**

UC Volume requirements:
- External Volume → requires UC External Location (blocked for S3 AP)
- Managed Volume → Databricks-managed S3 storage (not FSx for ONTAP)

## Connection Path Overview: What Works and What Doesn't

### RPO (Data Freshness) and Trade-offs by Path

| Path | RPO (Data Freshness) | Throughput | UC Governance | Data Copy |
|------|---------------------|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| DataSync → S3 → UC | 5 min – 24 hours (schedule-dependent) | High (DataSync optimized) | ✅ Full | Required (replicated to S3) |
| Kafka → SS → UC | Seconds – 10s (streaming latency) | Medium–High (partition parallelism) | ✅ Full | Required (Delta table conversion) |
| Glue/EMR ETL → UC | Minutes – hours (job schedule) | High (Spark distributed) | ✅ Full | Required (output to S3) |
| Foreign Iceberg | Near-real-time (REFRESH dependent) | Read-only | ✅ Read | Minimal (metadata only) |
| Athena + S3 AP (outside UC) | Real-time (S3 AP direct read) | Medium | ❌ AWS-side only | None (zero-copy) |
| boto3 PoC | Real-time | Low (driver only) | ❌ None | None |

### Snowflake vs Databricks Connection Comparison

Connectivity differences for FSx for ONTAP S3 AP:

| Capability | Snowflake | Databricks (UC) | Reason |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| External Table (S3 AP) | ✅ Works | ❌ Blocked | Snowflake resolves S3 AP via `AWS_ACCESS_POINT_ARN`. UC session policy doesn't handle S3 AP |
| Directory Table / Volume | ✅ Works | ❌ Blocked | Same (External Location dependency) |
| Event-driven Snowpipe / Auto Loader | ⚠️ Via FPolicy | ❌ Blocked | S3 Event Notifications not available on FSx for ONTAP S3 AP. Both need FPolicy alternative |
| Zero-copy read | ✅ | ❌ | UC requires standard S3 buckets only |
| Governance (Tags, Masking) | ✅ | ✅ (after S3 ingestion) | UC governance applies to S3-resident tables |
| AI/ML capabilities | Cortex AI (limited) | Mosaic AI (full) | ML training / Feature Store stronger on Databricks |

**Selection guidance**: If zero-copy + governance is top priority, choose Snowflake. If full AI/ML pipeline is needed, choose Databricks (via DataSync). The two are not mutually exclusive — both can access the same FSx for ONTAP data concurrently.

> **Note: Lakehouse Federation** — UC Lakehouse Federation issues read queries from UC to MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQL Server / Snowflake / Redshift / BigQuery, etc. FSx for ONTAP is not an RDBMS and is not a direct Federation target. However, Federation to ClickHouse via its PostgreSQL-compatible port (9005) is theoretically possible (unverified). See [Kafka-ClickHouse-UC connectivity guide](./kafka-clickhouse-unity-catalog-connectivity.md).

## Recommended Path Details

### Path 1: DataSync → S3 → UC (Recommended for production)

**The only verified production path. FSx for ONTAP NFS → S3 periodic sync → UC External/Managed tables.**

```
FSx for ONTAP (NFS)
  ↓ AWS DataSync (rate(5 minutes) to daily)
Amazon S3 bucket (standard)
  ↓
UC External Location (Storage Credential + IAM Role)
  ↓
UC External Table / Managed Table / Volume
```

**Procedure overview** ([detailed guide](./datasync-to-s3-guide.md)):

```bash
# 1. DataSync source (FSx for ONTAP NFS)
aws datasync create-location-fsx-ontap \
  --storage-virtual-machine-arn <SVM_ARN> \
  --protocol NFS={} \
  --subdirectory /vol1/data/

# 2. DataSync destination (S3)
aws datasync create-location-s3 \
  --s3-bucket-arn arn:aws:s3:::<BUCKET> \
  --s3-config BucketAccessRoleArn=<ROLE_ARN>

# 3. DataSync task
aws datasync create-task \
  --source-location-arn <SRC> \
  --destination-location-arn <DST> \
  --options '{"TransferMode":"CHANGED","PreserveDeletedFiles":"REMOVE"}'

# 4. Schedule
aws datasync update-task --task-arn <TASK> \
  --schedule ScheduleExpression="rate(5 minutes)"
```

> **Note**: `rate(5 minutes)` is for small environments. In high-file-count environments, task overlap risk exists (next invocation starts before previous completes). For production, recommend `rate(15 minutes)` to `rate(1 hour)`. If file counts exceed tens of thousands, split targets with includes/excludes filters across multiple tasks.

> **Bandwidth estimation** (Network Fabric Specialist findings): DataSync transfer time is constrained by FSx for ONTAP throughput capacity + VPC network bandwidth. Estimate before implementation:
> - Example: 100GB data, 1Gbps bandwidth → theoretical ~13 min (effective 60-70% → ~20 min)
> - Enable VPC jumbo frames (MTU 9001) for significant NFS throughput improvement
> - FSx for ONTAP throughput capacity (128MB/s–4GB/s) may be the bottleneck

> **IAM least privilege** (IAM Security Architect findings): Restrict the DataSync execution IAM Role to:
> - S3 destination: `s3:PutObject`, `s3:DeleteObject`, `s3:GetBucketLocation` only (resource ARN constrained to specific bucket/prefix)
> - FSx for ONTAP source: `fsx:DescribeFileSystems`, `datasync:*` minimum required
> - Wildcard permissions (`s3:*`, `fsx:*`) are prohibited

```sql
-- 5. Register UC External Location
CREATE EXTERNAL LOCATION fsxn_synced
  URL 's3://<BUCKET>/fsxn-sync/'
  WITH (STORAGE CREDENTIAL <credential_name>);

-- 6. Create table
CREATE TABLE catalog.schema.sensor_data
USING DELTA
AS SELECT * FROM parquet.`s3://<BUCKET>/fsxn-sync/sensor-data/`;
```

**Applicable scenarios**: Periodic analytics on structured data, ML training data, reporting

> **Recommendation: Sync from Snapshot** (FSx for ONTAP Architect findings): Syncing directly from a production volume risks data inconsistency if files change during the sync. The recommended pattern is "Snapshot → FlexClone → DataSync":
> 1. Take a Snapshot (point-in-time consistent copy)
> 2. Create a FlexClone (instant, zero-copy)
> 3. Run DataSync against the FlexClone
> 4. Delete FlexClone after sync completes
>
> This ensures zero production impact and guarantees data consistency.

> **Auto Loader integration** (Data Engineering SA findings): After DataSync syncs to S3, use **Auto Loader** for incremental ingestion. Defining as a **DLT (Spark Declarative Pipelines)** streaming table further automates monitoring, error handling, and schema evolution:
> ```python
> # DLT pipeline definition
> import dlt
>
> @dlt.table
> def sensor_data():
>     return (spark.readStream
>         .format("cloudFiles")  # Auto Loader
>         .option("cloudFiles.format", "parquet")
>         .load("s3://<BUCKET>/fsxn-sync/sensor-data/")
>     )
> ```

> **Medallion architecture mapping** (DLT Pipeline Architect findings): DataSync → S3 is the **Bronze layer** (raw data). Silver (cleansed) / Gold (business aggregates) transformations are defined in DLT:
> ```
> Bronze: DataSync → S3 (raw files) → Auto Loader → streaming_table
> Silver: DLT quality checks (expectations: null/range/referential integrity) + schema normalization
> Gold:   DLT aggregation + business logic + Liquid Clustering + OPTIMIZE (BI query optimization)
> ```

> **Auto Loader mode selection** (Cost Optimization Specialist findings): The DataSync target S3 bucket supports **S3 Event Notifications** (unlike FSx for ONTAP S3 AP). Use Auto Loader's **file notification mode** (via SQS) — significantly reduces scan costs compared to directory listing mode.

---

### Path 2: Kafka → Structured Streaming → UC Delta (Real-time)

**FPolicy detects file changes, Lambda sends to Kafka, Databricks writes to UC Delta tables.**

```
FSx for ONTAP
  ↓ FPolicy (file operation event detection)
AWS Lambda
  ↓ Kafka Producer
Amazon MSK (Kafka)
  ↓ Structured Streaming (DBR 16.1+, UC service credentials)
UC-managed Delta Table
```

**Procedure overview** ([detailed guide](./kafka-clickhouse-unity-catalog-connectivity.md)):

```python
# Databricks Structured Streaming
df = (spark.readStream
  .format("kafka")
  .option("kafka.bootstrap.servers", "<MSK_BOOTSTRAP>")
  .option("subscribe", "fsxn-events")
  .option("kafka.security.protocol", "SASL_SSL")
  .option("kafka.sasl.mechanism", "AWS_MSK_IAM")
  .load()
)

# Write to UC-managed Delta table
(df.selectExpr("CAST(value AS STRING) as json_payload")
  .writeStream
  .format("delta")
  .option("checkpointLocation", "/Volumes/catalog/schema/checkpoints/")
  .toTable("catalog.schema.fsxn_events")
)
```

**Applicable scenarios**: Event-driven ingestion, near-real-time quality inspection, streaming ETL

> **Note: FPolicy delivers metadata events only** (Edge Data Architect findings): FPolicy detects file **operation events** (create, update, delete, rename) but does not transfer file **content**. Typical design pattern:
> - **Kafka messages**: Metadata only (file path, size, operation type, timestamp)
> - **Payload reads**: Databricks Spark reads file content directly via S3 AP (outside UC path), or reads from DataSync-synced S3 copy
>
> For large files (video, etc.), note Lambda's 15-minute timeout and 10GB memory limit. For large payloads, combine with the DataSync path.

> **Manufacturing data flow origin** (Manufacturing DX Specialist findings): PLCs / SCADA systems typically cannot act as Kafka Producers directly. The typical manufacturing data flow is:
> ```
> PLC / SCADA → NFS/SMB write → FSx for ONTAP → FPolicy detection → Lambda → Kafka
> ```
> FPolicy detects events "after a file is written", not direct streaming from PLCs.
> In environments where OT networks (FSx for ONTAP) and IT networks (Databricks / MSK) are separated, design Lambda / DataSync communication paths via Transit Gateway / VPC Peering.

> **Industrial protocol data flows** (Industrial Protocol / AWS IoT Specialist findings): In real manufacturing environments, intermediate layers are more common than direct PLC file output:
> ```
> Pattern A: PLC → OPC UA Server → Historian → CSV/Parquet export → FSx for ONTAP (NFS)
> Pattern B: PLC → MQTT Broker (Sparkplug B) → Kafka Bridge → MSK → UC Delta
> Pattern C: PLC → AWS IoT SiteWise Edge → FSx for ONTAP (NFS) → FPolicy / DataSync
> Pattern D: PLC → AWS IoT Greengrass (Lambda@Edge) → FSx for ONTAP (NFS) → DataSync → S3 → UC
> ```
> PLC output may be in proprietary binary format (.dat, .bin), requiring custom parser development for CSV/JSON conversion.

> **OT/IT security boundary** (OT Network Security / Industrial Cybersecurity Specialist findings):
> - **Purdue Level 3.5 (IDMZ)**: FPolicy Lambda and DataSync agents should be placed in Level 3.5 (Industrial DMZ), avoiding direct OT (Level 0-3) to IT (Level 4-5) connections
> - **IDMZ allowed ports**: NFS 2049 (FSx for ONTAP → DataSync), HTTPS 443 (Lambda → MSK IAM / DataSync → S3), Kafka 9094-9098 (Lambda → MSK TLS/IAM)
> - **IEC 62443 compliant environments**: NFS communication should use `krb5p` (Kerberos encryption), with traffic routed through IDMZ conduits meeting channel security requirements
> - **Encryption** (Compliance Specialist findings): DataSync uses TLS (in-transit) + S3 SSE-KMS (at-rest). FSx for ONTAP uses volume encryption (at-rest) + NFS krb5p (in-transit). Regulated industries (GxP, ITAR) require documentation of this encryption chain
> - **Data diode environments** (high-security): FSx for ONTAP → S3 one-way DataSync flow serves as a logical alternative to physical data diodes
> - **Audit log 4 layers** (Security Audit Analyst findings): Four layers of audit logs are generated across the data flow. Design correlation analysis for incident response:
>   1. ONTAP FPolicy / audit log (file operations)
>   2. DataSync CloudTrail (transfer operations)
>   3. S3 access logs / CloudTrail data events (object operations)
>   4. UC audit logs (table access, queries)
> - **Evidence preservation** (Incident Response Specialist findings): During security incidents, FSx for ONTAP **SnapLock** preserves tamper-proof Snapshots. Ensures forensic data integrity via WORM (Write Once Read Many)
> - **Secrets management**: Passwords for Lakehouse Federation external DB connections must be managed via **Databricks Secrets** (`secret('scope', 'key')` function). Plaintext in code is prohibited. AWS Secrets Manager integration also available

> **DLT / CDC patterns** (Data Engineering SA findings):
> - **DLT (Streaming Table)**: For production, define streaming tables in DLT instead of writing Structured Streaming directly. Built-in monitoring, error handling, and schema evolution.
> - **CDC (Change Data Capture)**: To replicate PostgreSQL / MySQL master data changes to UC Delta in real-time, use the **Debezium → Kafka → DLT** pattern:
>   ```
>   EC2 PostgreSQL (on FSx for ONTAP) → Debezium Connector → MSK → DLT Streaming Table → UC Delta
>   ```
>   Applicable for real-time replication of manufacturing master data (product masters, equipment registries) to the analytics platform.

> **Delivery guarantees and deduplication** (Data Reliability Engineer findings): The FPolicy → Lambda → Kafka path provides **at-least-once** delivery. Network retries and Lambda retries may produce duplicate events. Design **event_id-based deduplication (MERGE / dedup)** on the UC Delta table side:
> ```sql
> MERGE INTO catalog.schema.fsxn_events AS target
> USING (SELECT * FROM stream_batch) AS source
> ON target.event_id = source.event_id
> WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT *;
> ```

> **Zerobus Ingest vs Kafka selection criteria** (Zerobus Specialist findings):
>
> | Dimension | Zerobus Ingest | Kafka (MSK) |
> |---|---|---|
> | Management | Databricks fully managed | User-managed or MSK managed |
> | Latency | Sub-second (direct to Databricks) | Seconds (via Spark Streaming) |
> | External consumers | ❌ Databricks only | ✅ Multiple consumers (ClickHouse, etc.) |
> | Edge connectivity | HTTPS REST / SDK | Kafka protocol (9094, etc.) |
> | Existing Kafka | Not needed | Leverage if available |
> | Best for | IoT events consumed only by Databricks | Multi-system fan-out |
>
> **Selection guidance**: Use Zerobus if Databricks is the only consumer. Use Kafka if fan-out to other systems (ClickHouse, etc.) is needed. Using both (Kafka + Zerobus → separate tables) is also valid.

### Path 3: Glue / EMR ETL → UC (Batch transformation)

**AWS Glue or EMR reads directly from FSx for ONTAP S3 AP, writes Delta/Parquet to S3.**

```
FSx for ONTAP (S3 AP)
  ↓ Glue ETL Job / EMR Spark
Amazon S3 (Delta / Parquet)
  ↓
UC External Location → Table
```

**Official tutorials**:
- [AWS Glue + FSx for ONTAP](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/tutorial-transform-data-with-glue.html)
- [EMR Serverless + FSx for ONTAP](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/tutorial-run-spark-with-emr-serverless.html)

**Applicable scenarios**: Large-scale batch transformation, schema conversion, data quality checks

---

### Path 4: Foreign Iceberg (via Glue REST, validating)

**Iceberg-format FSx for ONTAP data exposed to UC Foreign Catalog via Glue Iceberg REST endpoint.**

```
FSx for ONTAP (S3 AP)
  ↓ PyIceberg / Glue (write Iceberg tables)
S3 Tables / Glue Catalog (Iceberg metadata)
  ↓ Iceberg REST endpoint
UC Foreign Catalog (read-only)
```

**Status**: ❌ **Blocked confirmed (2026-06-21)**. `iceberg_rest` connection type not available in ap-northeast-1 workspace. S3 Tables managed bucket UC External Location registration also fails. ([Validation results](../../integrations/iceberg-metadata-catalog/databricks/uc-foreign-iceberg-validation.md#validation-execution-results-2026-06-21))

> **Operational note** (Iceberg Specialist findings): `REFRESH FOREIGN TABLE` does not execute automatically (Databricks does not auto-detect external Iceberg metadata updates). If periodic refresh is needed, configure a **Databricks Workflow** scheduled job.

---

### Path 5: ClickHouse → UC (DataLakeCatalog, reverse read)

**ClickHouse reads UC Delta/Iceberg tables via credential vending.**

After FSx for ONTAP data is ingested into UC Delta tables, ClickHouse can also reference the same data under UC governance.

```sql
-- ClickHouse side
CREATE DATABASE uc_delta
ENGINE = DataLakeCatalog('unity', '<WORKSPACE_URL>', '<TOKEN>')
SETTINGS catalog_type = 'unity';

SELECT * FROM uc_delta.catalog.schema.sensor_data LIMIT 10;
```

**Details**: [Kafka-ClickHouse-UC connectivity guide](./kafka-clickhouse-unity-catalog-connectivity.md)

---

## Why Direct Connection Is Not Possible: Technical Reasons

### UC External Location Session Policy Constraint

When Databricks assumes an IAM Role via AssumeRole, it internally generates a **session policy**. This policy is built assuming:

1. Storage paths are in `s3://<bucket-name>/prefix/` format
2. `arn:aws:s3:::<bucket-name>` is a valid S3 bucket ARN
3. ListObjectsV2 / GetObject / PutObject work via standard S3 API

For S3 Access Points:
- Paths are in `s3://<access-point-alias>/prefix/` format
- ARN is `arn:aws:s3:region:account:accesspoint/name`
- The session policy resource constraints do not correctly handle S3 AP ARNs

**Result**: Some top-level operations succeed (as a side effect), but subdirectory operations, table creation, and writes all return `AccessDenied`.

### NFS/SMB Mount Constraints

Databricks runtime runs on Docker containers with **seccomp (Secure Computing Mode) profiles** that prohibit `mount` / `umount` system calls:
- Kernel NFS mount (`mount -t nfs`) → blocked
- FUSE mounts (`s3fs`, `nfs-ganesha`) → blocked
- SMB mount (`mount -t cifs`) → blocked

This is a security design constraint with no workaround.

### ONTAP S3 Constraints

ONTAP S3 provides an S3 API-compatible protocol, but:
- No API exists to specify a custom endpoint URL for UC External Location
- UC only accepts `s3://<bucket-name>/` format paths and has no `endpoint_url` parameter for custom S3 endpoints

## Phased Adoption Recommended Steps

(Manufacturing IT/OT Convergence Program Manager findings)

For large manufacturing environments, implement paths incrementally rather than all at once:

| Phase | Content | Duration | Success Criteria |
|-------|---------|----------|------------------|
| **1. PoC** | DataSync → S3 → UC table (1 volume, structured data only) | 2-4 weeks | Queryable in UC, data freshness OK |
| **2. Production** | DataSync schedule optimization + Auto Loader + DLT (medallion) | 4-8 weeks | Bronze/Silver/Gold pipeline running |
| **3. Real-time** | FPolicy → Lambda → Kafka → SS → UC Delta (event-driven) | 4-8 weeks | Near-real-time event ingestion |
| **4. AI/ML** | UC Volume + Feature Store + AI Search + Bedrock KB | 4-12 weeks | ML pipeline operational |
| **5. Multi-system** | Lakehouse Federation (EC2 DB) + ClickHouse integration | 4-8 weeks | Unified analytics view |

> **Note**: Phases 1-2 apply to nearly all customers. Phases 3+ are use-case-driven and selectively implemented.

## EC2 Self-Managed DB × FSx for ONTAP × UC Connection Patterns

### Overview

When running self-managed databases/streaming platforms on EC2 with FSx for ONTAP as the data store, this section covers how each connects to Databricks UC.

### UC Lakehouse Federation Supported Databases

UC Lakehouse Federation executes **pushdown queries** against external databases via JDBC, providing UC governance on reads:

| Database | Federation Status | EC2 Self-Managed | FSx for ONTAP as Data Store | UC Connection |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|
| **PostgreSQL** | ✅ GA | ✅ | ✅ NFS mountable | `CREATE CONNECTION TYPE postgresql` |
| **MySQL** | ✅ GA | ✅ | ✅ NFS mountable | `CREATE CONNECTION TYPE mysql` |
| **SQL Server** | ✅ GA | ✅ | ⚠️ SMB only (Linux version: NFS) | `CREATE CONNECTION TYPE sqlserver` |
| **Oracle** | ✅ Public Preview | ✅ | ✅ NFS (ASM not supported, FS-based only) | `CREATE CONNECTION TYPE oracle` |
| **Teradata** | ✅ Public Preview | ✅ | ⚠️ Limited (proprietary storage preferred) | `CREATE CONNECTION TYPE teradata` |
| **Snowflake** | ✅ GA | — (SaaS) | — | `CREATE CONNECTION TYPE snowflake` |
| **Redshift** | ✅ GA | — (Managed) | — | `CREATE CONNECTION TYPE redshift` |
| **BigQuery** | ✅ GA | — (SaaS) | — | `CREATE CONNECTION TYPE bigquery` |
| **Databricks** | ✅ GA | — | — | `CREATE CONNECTION TYPE databricks` |

> **Critical constraints**:
> - Lakehouse Federation is **read-only**. INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE from UC to external DBs is not supported. Data ingestion to external DBs must be designed separately.
> - **Network prerequisites**: If the EC2 DB is in a private subnet, connecting from Databricks serverless compute requires **NCC (Network Connectivity Config)** or **PrivateLink** configuration. Classic compute requires VPC Peering / Transit Gateway.
>   - NCC limits (AWS): Max 10 NCCs / region per account, 30 Private Endpoints / region
>   - NCC cost: Per-hour charge per Private Endpoint + per-GB data processing charge
> - **Query characteristics**: Federation uses JDBC pushdown, making it unsuitable for full-scan analytics on large datasets. It is optimized for filtering / lookup / small-to-medium aggregation queries. For large-scale analytics, use Path 1 (DataSync → UC Delta).
> - **Non-pushdown operations** (Federation Query Optimizer findings): WINDOW functions, complex UDFs, some LIKE patterns (leading wildcard `%abc`) are NOT pushed down — all rows are transferred over the network causing performance degradation. Check query plans with `EXPLAIN` and verify PushedFilters / PushedAggregates.

### EC2 Self-Managed DBs That Can Use FSx for ONTAP as Data Store

| DB / Middleware | Data Directory | FSx for ONTAP Protocol | Practicality | UC Connection |
|---|---|---|:---:|---|
| **PostgreSQL** | `data_directory` | NFS | ✅ Recommended | Lakehouse Federation (JDBC) |
| **MySQL / MariaDB** | `datadir` | NFS | ✅ Recommended | Lakehouse Federation (JDBC) |
| **MongoDB** | `dbPath` | NFS | ⚠️ Works but WiredTiger journal fsync tuning required. **Lakehouse Federation not supported** (Spark MongoDB Connector only) | Spark MongoDB Connector → UC Delta |
| **ClickHouse** | `path` | NFS / ONTAP S3 (cold tier) | ✅ Verified | DataLakeCatalog (UC → CH) / reverse only |
| **Kafka** | `log.dirs` | NFS | ⚠️ If latency increase acceptable | Structured Streaming → UC Delta |
| **Redis / Valkey** | RDB/AOF files | NFS | ⚠️ Persistence only (cache-primary) | Spark Redis Connector → UC Delta |
| **Elasticsearch / OpenSearch** | `path.data` | NFS | ❌ data NOT recommended ([officially unsupported](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/storage-types.html), translog corruption risk). ✅ Snapshot repository via NFS is supported | Spark ES Connector → UC Delta |
| **Apache Cassandra** | `data_file_directories` | NFS | ❌ Not recommended (local SSD design) | Spark Cassandra Connector → UC Delta |
| **Neo4j** | `dbms.directories.data` | NFS | ⚠️ Small-scale only | Spark Neo4j Connector → UC Delta |
| **InfluxDB** | `data-dir` | NFS | ⚠️ Small-scale only | Spark JDBC (Flux SQL) → UC Delta |
| **TimescaleDB** | `data_directory` (PG extension) | NFS | ✅ Same as PostgreSQL (Federation supported) | Lakehouse Federation (JDBC) — same path as PostgreSQL |
| **Apache Druid** | `druid.storage.*` | NFS (deep storage) / ONTAP S3 | ✅ Suitable as deep storage (when using ONTAP S3, custom endpoint URL configuration via `druid.storage.baseKey` required) | Spark JDBC → UC Delta |
| **Apache Pinot** | segment store | NFS / ONTAP S3 | ⚠️ Viable as deep storage | Spark Connector → UC Delta |
| **MinIO** | `MINIO_VOLUMES` | NFS / block storage | ✅ | S3-compatible → Spark read → UC Delta |

### DB × FSx for ONTAP × UC Connection Pattern Classification

```
Pattern A: Lakehouse Federation (JDBC pushdown)
  EC2 DB (PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQL Server/Oracle)
    ↑ data on FSx for ONTAP (NFS/SMB)
    ↓ JDBC
  Databricks UC Foreign Catalog
    → UC governance applied (tags, row filters, lineage)
    → No data movement (queries execute remotely)

Pattern B: Structured Streaming → UC Delta
  EC2 Streaming platform (Kafka/Pulsar)
    ↑ logs on FSx for ONTAP (NFS)
    ↓ Kafka protocol
  Databricks Structured Streaming
    → Write to UC-managed Delta tables
    → Near-real-time

Pattern C: Spark Connector → UC Delta (Batch ETL)
  EC2 DB (MongoDB/Cassandra/Elasticsearch/Redis)
    ↑ data on FSx for ONTAP (NFS)
    ↓ Dedicated Spark Connector (JDBC/API)
  Databricks ETL Job
    → Write to UC-managed Delta tables
    → Batch (scheduled)

Pattern D: Reverse read (external engine → UC)
  EC2 DB (ClickHouse)
    ↓ UC Iceberg REST / credential vending
  Read Databricks UC Delta/Iceberg tables
    → External engines consume data under UC governance
```

### Kafka × FSx for ONTAP Details

| Aspect | NFS (FSx for ONTAP) | Local EBS |
|--------|---------------------|-----------|
| Latency | +1-3ms (network hop) | ~0.1ms |
| `log.dirs` usage | ✅ Works | ✅ Recommended |
| Snapshot recovery | ✅ Full broker PIT recovery | EBS Snapshot (AZ-scoped) |
| SnapMirror DR | ✅ Cross-region | EBS is AZ-scoped, separate design needed |
| Multi-broker sharing | ❌ Not recommended (partition exclusivity assumed) | — |
| MSK usage | ❌ Not possible (managed storage fixed) | — |
| Tiered Storage | FabricPool auto-tiers cold segments to S3 | Kafka native Tiered Storage |

**Recommended patterns**:
- **Latency-critical (production streaming)**: EBS (io2/gp3) + Kafka MirrorMaker 2 for DR
- **Data protection / operational integration**: FSx for ONTAP NFS + Snapshot/SnapMirror (when latency acceptable)
- **Hybrid**: Hot data = EBS, cold segments = FSx for ONTAP (FabricPool to S3 tier)

### ClickHouse × FSx for ONTAP Details

**storage_policy tiered design** (ClickHouse Specialist findings):

```xml
<!-- ClickHouse storage_policy configuration example -->
<storage_configuration>
  <disks>
    <hot>
      <type>local</type>
      <path>/var/lib/clickhouse/</path> <!-- local SSD -->
    </hot>
    <cold>
      <type>s3</type>
      <endpoint>https://<SVM_S3_ENDPOINT>:443/<BUCKET>/</endpoint>
      <access_key_id>***</access_key_id>
      <secret_access_key>***</secret_access_key>
    </cold>
  </disks>
  <policies>
    <tiered>
      <volumes>
        <hot><disk>hot</disk></hot>
        <cold><disk>cold</disk></cold>
      </volumes>
      <move_factor>0.1</move_factor> <!-- move to cold at 10% usage -->
    </tiered>
  </policies>
</storage_configuration>
```

**UC connection — DataLakeCatalog type selection**:
- `catalog_type = 'unity'` → Read UC **Delta tables**
- `catalog_type = 'rest'` → Read **Iceberg tables** via UC Iceberg REST endpoint

```sql
-- Read Delta tables
CREATE DATABASE uc_delta ENGINE = DataLakeCatalog('unity', '<URL>', '<TOKEN>')
SETTINGS catalog_type = 'unity';

-- Read Iceberg tables
CREATE DATABASE uc_iceberg ENGINE = DataLakeCatalog('rest', '<URL>', '<TOKEN>')
SETTINGS catalog_type = 'rest';
```

> **⚠️ ClickHouse Keeper / ZooKeeper on FSx for ONTAP is NOT recommended**: Keeper transaction logs require ultra-low-latency (<1ms) fsync. The additional 1-3ms from NFS impacts cluster-wide replication performance. Place Keeper / ZK data on **local SSD (io2)**.

### PostgreSQL / MySQL × FSx for ONTAP Details

PostgreSQL and MySQL are the **most recommended** combinations with FSx for ONTAP:

- PostgreSQL: `data_directory = '/mnt/fsxn/pgdata'` → WAL / tablespaces on NFS
- MySQL: `datadir = /mnt/fsxn/mysql` → InnoDB tablespaces on NFS

> **Recommended NFS mount options** (NFS Performance Architect / PostgreSQL DBA findings):
> ```bash
> # DB workload-optimized FSx for ONTAP NFS mount
> mount -t nfs4.1 <SVM_NFS_LIF>:/vol1/pgdata /mnt/fsxn/pgdata \
>   -o hard,nointr,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,noac,nfsvers=4.1
> ```
> - `nfsvers=4.1`: Session trunking + delegation for improved performance
> - `noac`: Disable attribute caching (ensures DB write-read consistency)
> - `hard`: Infinite retry on server non-response (prevents data corruption)
> - `rsize/wsize=1048576`: 1MB I/O (maximizes throughput)

> **MySQL-specific note**: On NFS, use `innodb_flush_method = fsync`. `O_DIRECT` may not function correctly on NFS.

> **Lakebase migration option** (Databricks Lakebase Specialist findings): If PostgreSQL workloads prioritize UC governance integration, **Databricks Lakebase** (managed PostgreSQL-compatible DB, GA) is an alternative. Lakebase offers native UC integration + Lakehouse//RT queries + Private Link. Note: not available in ap-northeast-1 (as of 2026-06-18).

**UC connection**:
```sql
-- Databricks side
CREATE CONNECTION pg_on_fsxn TYPE postgresql
OPTIONS (
  host = '<EC2_PRIVATE_IP>',
  port = '5432',
  user = 'readonly_user',
  password = secret('scope', 'pg_password')
);

CREATE FOREIGN CATALOG pg_catalog
USING CONNECTION pg_on_fsxn
OPTIONS (database = 'manufacturing');

-- Query (pushdown execution)
SELECT * FROM pg_catalog.public.sensor_readings
WHERE timestamp > '2026-06-01';
```

**FSx for ONTAP value**:
- Snapshot → No logical backup needed (consistent PIT recovery)
- FlexClone → Instant dev/test DB creation (zero-copy clone of production data)
- SnapMirror → DR site replication (no pg_basebackup / mysqldump needed)
- Multi-protocol → Same volume's DB data also analyzable via S3 AP from Glue/Athena

> **WAL performance note** (Databricks SA findings): PostgreSQL WAL fsync over NFS adds 1-3ms latency vs local disk. For high-throughput write environments, consider:
> - `synchronous_commit = off` (only if data loss risk is acceptable)
> - Separate WAL on local EBS, data files only on FSx for ONTAP NFS
> - Streaming replication (primary: EBS, standby: FSx for ONTAP → connect Lakehouse Federation to standby)

### AI/ML Data Access Paths

Paths for using FSx for ONTAP data with Databricks AI/ML features (AI/GenAI Specialist findings):

| AI/ML Feature | Required Data Form | Path from FSx for ONTAP |
|---|---|---|
| **Feature Store** | UC table | DataSync → S3 → UC table → Feature Table registration. Feature freshness depends on DataSync RPO (5 min – 24 hours). Use Path 2 (Kafka → SS) for real-time feature updates |
| **AI Search (Vector Search)** | UC Volume or table | DataSync → S3 → UC Volume → AI Search Pipeline |
| **MLflow Artifact** | UC Volume or S3 | DataSync → S3 → UC Volume path |
| **Model Serving (input data)** | API request | App layer reads via S3 AP → call serving API |
| **Bedrock KB (RAG)** | S3 AP direct | FSx for ONTAP S3 AP → Bedrock KB (outside UC, official tutorial) |
| **Document Intelligence** | Via S3 | DataSync → S3 → Lakeflow → structured table |

> **Edge AI image inspection path** (Edge AI Vision Engineer findings): Path for managing inspection images (with inference results) from NVIDIA Jetson / AWS Panorama edge AI cameras in UC:
> ```
> Edge AI camera → local NVMe buffer → batch transfer → FSx for ONTAP (NFS) → DataSync → S3 → UC Volume
> ```
> High-speed capture (10-100 images/sec/line) requires local buffering. Direct NFS write is not recommended due to bandwidth constraints.

> **RAG / AI Search pipeline** (RAG Pipeline Engineer findings): Concrete flow to make FSx for ONTAP documents searchable via AI Search:
> ```
> FSx for ONTAP (documents) → DataSync → S3 → UC Volume
>   → Spark UDF (chunking: RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter etc.)
>   → Embedding Model (Databricks FMAPI or Bedrock)
>   → AI Search Index (sync index on UC table)
>   → Agent retriever tool (RAG query)
> ```

> **Image embedding pipeline** (Multimodal Vision Architect findings): To enable similarity search on inspection images via AI Search:
> ```
> UC Volume (inspection images) → Spark UDF (CLIP / ViT embedding generation) → AI Search Index → similar image search
> ```

## Cost Comparison

| Path | Storage Cost | Compute Cost | Operational Overhead |
|------|-------------|--------------|---------------------|
| DataSync → S3 → UC | FSx for ONTAP + S3 (duplicate) | DataSync transfer + Databricks | Medium (schedule management) |
| Kafka → SS → UC | FSx for ONTAP (metadata only in Kafka) | MSK + Databricks Streaming | High (pipeline management) |
| Glue/EMR ETL | FSx for ONTAP + S3 (duplicate) | Glue/EMR job execution | Medium (job scheduling) |
| Athena (outside UC) | FSx for ONTAP only | Query scan-based billing | Low (serverless) |
| boto3 PoC | FSx for ONTAP only | Databricks cluster | Low (no governance) ⚠️ Data exfiltration risk |

> **boto3 PoC security warning** (Data Exfiltration Prevention Engineer findings): The boto3 PoC path completely bypasses UC governance, creating risk of users downloading data locally and exfiltrating externally. If used:
> - Enable Databricks workspace **egress controls** (S3 bucket policy + VPC endpoint policy to restrict destinations)
> - Apply **IP ACL** for source access restriction
> - Enable **audit logging** (CloudTrail + UC audit logs)
> - Time-limited approval (PoC period only)

## Future Outlook

> **Note on FabricPool and UC**: Data tiered to S3 via FSx for ONTAP's FabricPool technically resides on standard S3 buckets and is UC External Location-accessible. However, the FabricPool tier target is ONTAP-managed internal storage not intended for direct user registration in UC. This path is not practical and is not recommended.

| Item | Status | Unblocking Condition |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| UC External Location S3 AP support | ❌ Not supported (feature request filed) | Databricks platform development |
| UC Foreign Iceberg × S3 Tables | ❌ Blocked confirmed (2026-06-21) | `iceberg_rest` type not supported + S3 Tables EL registration fails. Awaiting Databricks Support |
| OpenSharing Volumes connector | 🔲 Design phase | Databricks development + FSx for ONTAP support |
| Lakebase × FSx for ONTAP | ⚠️ Lakebase not in ap-northeast-1 | Databricks region expansion |
