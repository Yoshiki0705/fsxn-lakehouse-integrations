# Recovery Semantics: ONTAP Snapshot vs. Lakehouse Time Travel

## Overview

This document clarifies the relationship between ONTAP Snapshot (storage-level point-in-time recovery) and Lakehouse time travel (Delta Lake / Apache Iceberg metadata-based logical recovery). These are **complementary but fundamentally different mechanisms** that protect against different failure modes.

## Mechanism Comparison

| Aspect | ONTAP Snapshot | Delta Lake Time Travel | Iceberg Time Travel |
|--------|---------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Layer** | Storage (block-level) | Table metadata (transaction log) | Table metadata (manifest list) |
| **Granularity** | Entire volume | Single table | Single table |
| **What is captured** | All files on volume at point-in-time | Table state per committed transaction | Table state per snapshot |
| **Recovery method** | Restore volume or access `.snapshot` directory | Query with `VERSION AS OF` or `TIMESTAMP AS OF` | Query with `snapshot_id` or `as_of_timestamp` |
| **Retention** | Configurable snapshot policy (hourly/daily/weekly) | Configurable `delta.logRetentionDuration` (default 30 days) | Configurable `history.expire.max-snapshot-age-ms` |
| **Space efficiency** | Copy-on-write (only changed blocks stored) | Previous data files retained until VACUUM | Previous data files retained until expiration |
| **Cross-table consistency** | Yes (volume-level atomic snapshot) | No (per-table only) | No (per-table only) |
| **Protects against** | Accidental deletion, corruption, ransomware, volume-level disasters | Logical errors in table operations, bad writes, schema mistakes | Same as Delta |
| **Does NOT protect against** | Logical application errors already committed | Storage-level failures, volume loss, multi-table inconsistency | Same as Delta |

## When to Use Which

### Use ONTAP Snapshot when:

| Scenario | Why Snapshot |
|----------|-------------|
| Volume-level disaster recovery | Restores all files atomically to a consistent point |
| Ransomware recovery | Immutable snapshots cannot be modified by compromised applications |
| Cross-table consistency | Need to restore multiple tables/files to the same point-in-time |
| Accidental volume deletion | Snapshot + SnapMirror provides off-volume protection |
| Compliance: long-term retention | SnapLock + Snapshot for WORM compliance |
| Pre-maintenance checkpoint | Quick rollback if maintenance causes issues |

### Use Lakehouse Time Travel when:

| Scenario | Why Time Travel |
|----------|----------------|
| Undo a bad table write | Revert a single table without affecting other data |
| Audit table changes | Query historical table state for compliance |
| Reproduce analytics results | Re-run queries against past table versions |
| Debug data pipeline | Compare table state before/after a transformation |
| Schema evolution rollback | Revert a schema change on a single table |

### Use Both Together when:

| Scenario | Approach |
|----------|----------|
| Defense in depth | Snapshot for storage-level protection + time travel for logical-level protection |
| Regulated environments | Snapshot for disaster recovery SLA + time travel for audit trail |
| Multi-table pipeline failure | Snapshot to restore volume to consistent state, then time travel to verify individual table states |

## Important Caveats for FSx S3 Access Point Context

1. **Lakehouse time travel requires write access**: Delta Lake and Iceberg time travel depend on transaction logs/metadata being written alongside data. Since FSx S3 AP has limitations on atomic rename (required by Delta) and conditional writes, **time travel is only available for tables whose transaction logs are managed externally** (e.g., Iceberg with Glue Catalog as metadata store) or for read-only access to pre-existing versioned tables.

2. **ONTAP Snapshot works regardless of access method**: Snapshots capture the volume state at the block level, independent of whether data was written via NFS, SMB, or S3 API. This makes Snapshot the **primary recovery mechanism** for data accessed through S3 Access Points.

3. **Snapshot does not understand table semantics**: Restoring a snapshot restores all files, including potentially in-progress writes. For Lakehouse tables, this means the table's transaction log and data files are restored together, which may leave the table in a state that requires repair (e.g., orphaned data files referenced by a rolled-back commit).

## Recovery Decision Matrix

| Failure Type | Primary Recovery | Secondary Recovery |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Accidental file deletion | ONTAP Snapshot (`.snapshot` directory access) | — |
| Bad data written to table | Lakehouse time travel (if available) | ONTAP Snapshot |
| Volume corruption | ONTAP Snapshot restore | SnapMirror failover |
| Ransomware | ONTAP Snapshot (immutable) | SnapMirror to isolated DR |
| Region failure | SnapMirror cross-region | — |
| Schema migration error | Lakehouse time travel | ONTAP Snapshot |
| Multi-table inconsistency | ONTAP Snapshot (volume-level atomic) | Manual reconciliation |
| Compliance audit (table history) | Lakehouse time travel | — |
| Compliance audit (storage history) | ONTAP Snapshot + SnapLock | — |

## RTO / RPO Comparison

| Mechanism | Typical RPO | Typical RTO | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| ONTAP Snapshot | Minutes to hours (per policy) | Seconds to minutes | Near-instant restore from snapshot |
| SnapMirror (async) | Minutes (per schedule) | Minutes | Failover to DR volume |
| SnapMirror (sync) | Zero | Minutes | Synchronous replication |
| Delta time travel | Per-commit (every write) | Seconds | Query-level, no restore needed |
| Iceberg time travel | Per-commit (every write) | Seconds | Query-level, no restore needed |
| FSx Backup | Daily (automatic) | Hours | Full volume restore from backup |
