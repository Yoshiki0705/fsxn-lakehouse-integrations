## Why layer matters

"FSx for ONTAP S3 Access Points do not support Lakehouse writes" is a claim this
repository can no longer make. Iceberg writes through Athena and the Glue Data
Catalog work end to end, verified 2026-08-06. Delta Lake writes do not. Both run
against the same Access Point.

The difference is not the storage. It is **where the table format keeps its commit
pointer**. Iceberg keeps it in the catalog, so the commit is a conditional update
in Glue. Delta keeps it in `_delta_log` on the object store, so the commit needs a
conditional write on the object store itself — which returns HTTP 501.

That distinction only becomes visible once problems are sorted by layer. Sorted by
engine, it looks like a list of unrelated failures.

| Layer | Who can change it | Problems originating here |
|---|---|:---:|
| 1. S3 API surface of the Access Point | AWS (with NetApp) | 8 |
| 2. FSx managed-service boundary over ONTAP | AWS | 3 |
| 3. Table format specifications | Apache / Delta projects | 2 |
| 4. Engine implementations | Each engine vendor | 7 |
| 5. Network path | Adopter's own design | 2 |
| 6. Governance surfaces | AWS / platform vendors | 2 |

---

## Layer 1 — The S3 API surface of the Access Point

These are gaps between what the Access Point implements and what Amazon S3
implements. No amount of engine configuration works around them.

| # | Gap | Observed behaviour | Downstream effect | Workaround |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | Conditional writes (`If-None-Match`) | HTTP 501 `NotImplemented`. Confirmed as a product-level limitation, 2026-05-22 | Delta Lake and Hudi commits impossible. Iceberg unaffected when the catalog holds the pointer | Iceberg via Athena + Glue, or write to standard S3 |
| 1.2 | Server-side encryption reported as `aws:fsx` | Neither `AWS_SSE_S3` nor `AWS_SSE_KMS`. Clients that validate a checksum against the returned encryption type reject the response **after the write has landed** | Snowflake `COPY INTO @stage` fails while leaving a complete object behind ([BLK-009](./blocker-tracker.md)) | Do not unload to an Access Point |
| 1.3 | S3 Event Notifications | Not emitted | No Snowpipe auto-ingest, no Auto Loader notification mode, no EventBridge trigger | FPolicy → Lambda, or DataSync → standard S3, or scheduled polling |
| 1.4 | Object Versioning | Not supported. `ListObjectVersions` returns `VersionId="null"` | No S3-native version history | ONTAP Snapshot for point-in-time recovery |
| 1.5 | Max single upload 5 GB | Multipart supported from ONTAP 9.16.1+ | Large-object writes need multipart | Chunk output files; target 128–256 MB anyway for scan efficiency |
| 1.6 | No Lifecycle policies, Object Lock, S3 Select, Cross-Region Replication | Not supported | Retention and tiering cannot be expressed in S3 terms | FabricPool tiering, SnapLock, query engines instead of S3 Select |
| 1.7 | Same region and same account required | Access Point must sit with the file system | No cross-account or cross-region Access Point topology | Share at the analytics layer instead of the storage layer |
| 1.8 | Presigned URLs officially unsupported | They work in practice, because presigning is a client-side signature and the server sees an ordinary signed request. AWS documents them as unsupported and does not guarantee stability | Anything built on them is unsupported | Do not depend on them in production |

**Minimum version**: ONTAP 9.17.1 for Access Points at all; 9.16.1 for multipart upload.

> **Note on 1.1 and 1.2 together**: these are the two gaps that produce residue
> rather than clean refusals. See [the partial-write hazard](#the-partial-write-hazard-two-causes-one-symptom).

---

## Layer 2 — The FSx managed-service boundary over ONTAP

ONTAP implements these. FSx for ONTAP does not expose them. The capability exists
in the product but not in the managed service.

| # | Gap | Observed behaviour | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2.1 | SnapMirror S3 disabled | `snapmirror object-store show` → `"object-store" is not a recognized command` at admin, advanced and diagnostic privilege. `/api/cloud/targets` → `not authorized for that command`. Tested on ONTAP 9.17.1P6. The `Continuous` SnapMirror policy exists in the system but cannot be referenced | ONTAP-native S3 replication unavailable. AWS DataSync (NFS → S3) is the only verified sync mechanism. On-premises ONTAP supports this from 9.10.1+, so migration plans that assume it need revising |
| 2.2 | One object-store server per SVM | `vserver object-store-server create` on an SVM that already has Access Points → `Only one object store server is supported per Vserver`. Access Points install an internal object-store server that `show` does not display | An SVM cannot host both Access Points and a native ONTAP S3 bucket. Structural, not a timing issue — use a separate SVM |
| 2.3 | Name-service stack sits in the S3 data path | If an SVM has DNS servers configured for AD membership and those become unreachable, **every Access Point on that SVM times out** — even with UNIX security style volumes, permissive export policies, and an `AVAILABLE` Access Point lifecycle state | An unrelated AD or DNS outage presents as an S3 storage outage. Diagnosis lands in the wrong layer. See [networking considerations](./fsx-ontap-s3ap-networking.md) |

---

## Layer 3 — Table format specifications

Nothing here is an FSx for ONTAP defect. These are consequences of how each format
defines a commit, interacting with gap 1.1.

| Format | Commit mechanism | Result on an Access Point | Status |
|---|---|:---:|---|
| Apache Iceberg | Current-metadata pointer held in the catalog. Commit is an atomic update in Glue | ✅ Works | Verified 2026-08-06 via Athena + Glue: CREATE, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, time travel, `OPTIMIZE`, `VACUUM`, and two concurrent commits all succeeded, with data and metadata both on the Access Point |
| Delta Lake | Commit log in `_delta_log/` on the object store. Needs atomic rename, or a conditional write | ❌ Fails | `Server returned non-2xx status code: 501 Not Implemented` on the initial commit file (delta-rs 1.2.1, 2026-05-23). Read path works normally |
| Apache Hudi | Timeline requires atomic rename (`.inflight` → `.commit`) | ❓ **Not tested** | The recorded conclusion is a deduction from the Delta result plus Hudi's architecture, not a measurement. An attempted EMR run did not proceed because the Hudi catalog plugin was absent from the default EMR 7.1.0 configuration. Tracked as UNV-023 |

> Hudi is the one entry in this document where the repository states a conclusion it
> did not measure. The reasoning is sound — the same atomic-rename requirement, the
> same missing primitive — but it is inference. It is listed here as inference.

---

## Layer 4 — Engine implementations

Same Access Point, same S3 API. These failures come from how each engine's client
code handles an Access Point alias, or from constraints unrelated to storage.

| # | Engine | Problem | Verbatim symptom | Workaround |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 4.1 | EMR Serverless (Iceberg write) | S3FileIO does not handle the Access Point alias during metadata write | `java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke "org.apache.iceberg.TableMetadata.metadataFileLocation()" because "metadata" is null` | Use Athena for Iceberg writes — the same table format succeeds there |
| 4.2 | Databricks Unity Catalog | An Access Point is not a supported External Location target; the `access_point` field is not GA. Confirmed by Databricks Support 2026-05-26 | `UC_CLOUD_STORAGE_ACCESS_FAILURE` on `CREATE TABLE` | DataSync → standard S3 → External Location ([BLK-001](./blocker-tracker.md)) |
| 4.3 | Databricks Unity Catalog | `iceberg_rest` is not an accepted Connection Type, so S3 Tables cannot be referenced as a Foreign Catalog | `CONNECTION_TYPE_NOT_SUPPORTED` (2026-05-31) | Glue HMS Federation (`CREATE CONNECTION TYPE glue`) is a GA path |
| 4.4 | Databricks Runtime | The runtime seccomp profile prohibits `mount` and `umount`, so NFS/SMB cannot be mounted from a cluster | — | Intentional security design; no resolution expected. Use the network paths instead |
| 4.5 | Snowflake | A Dynamic Table cannot select from an External Table | `Object ref EXT_FMT_JSON of type EXTERNAL_TABLE not supported in Dynamic Table definition` | `COPY INTO` a standard table first, then define the Dynamic Table over that. Verified working 2026-08-06 |
| 4.6 | Snowflake | An inline `FILE_FORMAT` is not accepted in the stage table-function form | — | Use a named `FILE FORMAT` object. Snowflake syntax, not an Access Point limitation |
| 4.7 | ClickHouse | `s3()` cannot receive an STS session token, so temporary credentials cannot be used | `UNKNOWN_SETTING: s3_session_token is neither a builtin setting` (v26.5.1) | IAM user long-term keys, or an EC2 Instance Profile via IMDS |

### Not an Access Point problem, but it will look like one

| Symptom | Actual cause |
|---|---|
| Spark, Glue or EMR cannot read Parquet that Athena and DuckDB read fine | Nanosecond timestamps. pandas and DuckDB `COPY TO` emit `TIMESTAMP(NANOS)` by default; Spark 3.3+ rejects it. Generate microsecond timestamps for cross-engine data |
| Redshift Serverless is slower than Athena on identical data | Serverless cold start. 5M rows: 4,277 ms versus 2,196 ms (2026-05-23) |

---

## Layer 5 — Network path

Both of these are decisions the adopting team makes, not service defects. They are
here because they are the most common first-hour failure.

| # | Problem | Mechanism | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5.1 | VPC-attached compute times out against an internet-origin Access Point | The alias resolves to `s3-r-w.<region>.amazonaws.com`, which may not be in the S3 prefix list that an S3 Gateway Endpoint uses. The Gateway Endpoint intercepts the traffic and fails to route it | Place the compute outside the VPC, route through a NAT Gateway, or use a VPC-origin Access Point with an S3 Interface Endpoint |
| 5.2 | Athena, EMR Serverless and Redshift Spectrum cannot use VPC-origin Access Points | They run on AWS-managed infrastructure outside the adopter's VPC | Internet-origin Access Point is required for these engines |

> **`HeadBucket` is not a health check.** It succeeds at the S3 layer without
> touching the file system, so it returns 200 even when data operations fail. Probe
> with `ListObjectsV2 --max-keys 1` instead.

---

## Layer 6 — Governance surfaces

| # | Problem | Effect | Workaround |
|---|---|---|---|
| 6.1 | Lake Formation column-level permissions are not implemented for S3 Tables federated catalogs | Table-level grants work; column masking does not | Put tables needing column-level control on ordinary Glue Catalog tables over general-purpose S3 |
| 6.2 | Unity Catalog governance cannot reach Access Point data | Lineage, tags, masks and row filters do not apply to FSx for ONTAP data directly. This follows from 4.2 | DataSync → standard S3 → External Location. Costs roughly $27/month/TB in transfer and storage against the governance gained |

---

## The partial-write hazard: two causes, one symptom

This is the finding with the largest operational consequence, and it is easy to
miss because the two causes sit in different layers.

Both produce the same shape: **the statement reports failure, and a complete or
partial object remains on the Access Point.**

| Cause | Layer | What is left behind |
|---|---|---|
| Delta commit hits the 501 (gap 1.1) | 1 | Delta writes Parquet first and commits second, so the data files stay with no `_delta_log`. Each retry adds more. Observed 2026-08-06: four prefixes with orphaned data files, one holding three files written a minute apart |
| Unload fails checksum validation (gap 1.2) | 1 | A complete, valid object. Measured: 25 bytes, valid gzip, correct content, `ServerSideEncryption: aws:fsx`. The statement failed in 479 ms |

A caller that treats a failed statement as "nothing happened" will be wrong in both
cases. Sweep for the residue with:

```bash
./shared/scripts/check_orphaned_unload_objects.py --access-point <alias>
```

It reports prefixes holding engine output with no completion marker
(`_SUCCESS`, `_delta_log/`, `_committed_*`) — the storage-side signature of an
interrupted write.

> Setting `ENCRYPTION=(TYPE='AWS_SSE_S3')` on a Snowflake stage does not fix 1.2. It
> replaces a fast failure with a hang: cancelled after 2 m 54 s, nothing written.

## What was withdrawn

Two claims this repository previously made did not survive measurement. They are
recorded because a withdrawn claim is also a result.

| Claim | What happened |
|---|---|
| ListObjectsV2 is 30–80x slower than native S3 | Re-measured 2026-08-05: **0.9–1.4x** for 10 to 5,000 objects, flat and nested layouts alike. The 30–80x figure did not reproduce and the origin was not determined. Behaviour above 5,000 objects in one directory remains unmeasured, and ONTAP sorts directory entries in memory, so file consolidation and partition structure remain sound design practice — just not because of a measured penalty at small scale |
| Snowflake external stages are read-only by design | Wrong, and it concealed 1.2. The write is not refused. It lands, then fails validation |
| Concurrent Iceberg writes risk corruption on an Access Point | That was inference, not measurement. Two concurrent Athena commits produced the correct row count with no lost update. A two-writer test is not a concurrency limit, but it does show the risk is not categorical |

---

## Where the boundaries of current knowledge are

Twenty-two items are untested; see the [unverified inventory](./unverified-inventory.md).
The three that most affect how the verified results should be read:

| Gap | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| Every Iceberg and Snowflake result used single-digit row counts | Manifest growth, compaction cost and partition evolution at realistic table size are unmeasured (UNV-021) |
| The Athena concurrency run was cache-resident | 25/25 queries succeeded and full scans degraded about 2x, but roughly 389 MB/s aggregate moved through a file system provisioned at 128 MBps. Caching did significant work. This is evidence that concurrency is not a failure mode up to 25, not a throughput model (UNV-022) |
| Hudi has never been run | See layer 3 |
