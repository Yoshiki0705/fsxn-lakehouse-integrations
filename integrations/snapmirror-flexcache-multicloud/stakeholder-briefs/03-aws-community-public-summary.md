## Title Candidates

- "FSx for ONTAP S3 Access Points + SnapMirror/FlexCache: Multi-Cloud Data Distribution Validated"
- "S3 API で書き込み、NFS/SMB で読み出す — FSx for ONTAP マルチクラウドデータ配信の実現可能性"

## Key Message (1 paragraph)

FSx for ONTAP S3 Access Points enable S3 API data ingestion into ONTAP volumes. Because S3 AP is implemented as a "lens" on a standard FlexVol (via ONTAP's S3 NAS bucket mechanism), these volumes can be protected and distributed using ONTAP's native SnapMirror and FlexCache capabilities. This means you can write data via S3 API, replicate it across regions or clouds with SnapMirror, and provide low-latency NFS/SMB read access at remote sites via FlexCache — all on the same volume.

---

## What We Validated (ONTAP 9.17.1)

### Works

| Capability | How it works |
|-----------|--------------|
| S3 AP volume → SnapMirror Async | Standard volume-level replication. Data written via S3 is replicated. |
| SnapMirror break → S3 AP re-attach | After failover, create a new S3 AP on the destination volume (~60s wait for API sync). |
| S3 AP volume → FlexCache Origin | Cache Volume provides NFS read access to data written via S3 AP. |
| Cross-region SnapMirror | FSx for ONTAP to FSx for ONTAP (any region pair). |
| Cross-cloud SnapMirror | FSx for ONTAP → CVO on GCP/Azure, on-premises ONTAP, GCNV. |
| FlexCache write-back | Remote sites can write via NFS/SMB on Cache; changes propagate to Origin. |
| Encryption in-transit | Cluster Peering Encryption (TLS 1.2) enabled by default. |

### Works With Caveats

| Capability | Caveat |
|-----------|--------|
| FlexCache write-back + S3 AP Origin writes | If S3 AP writes and Cache writes target the **same file**, Cache dirty data is overwritten. Design for non-overlapping file sets. |
| S3 AP re-attach timing | FSx API takes ~60s to reflect `VolumeType: RW` after SnapMirror break. Poll before attaching. |
| GCNV FlexCache | Cache-only (not Origin). NFSv3 access only. |

### Does Not Work

| Limitation | Alternative |
|-----------|-------------|
| SVM-DR (SVM-level SnapMirror) | Use volume-level SnapMirror + pre-configure destination SVM manually. |
| FSx for ONTAP → ANF (SnapMirror) | Use CVO on Azure as SnapMirror destination, or file-level sync tools. |
| SnapMirror Synchronous | Async only for S3 NAS bucket volumes (minimum 5-min schedule). |

## Architecture Decision Guide

### When to use SnapMirror

- Disaster recovery (full copy at destination, immediate failover)
- Data migration (one-time copy)
- Multi-cloud distribution (cross-cloud replication)
- When RPO of 5+ minutes is acceptable

### When to use FlexCache

- Read acceleration at remote sites (low-latency local reads)
- Multiple teams accessing same dataset from different locations
- Storage efficiency (only cached data consumes space)
- When WAN RTT is <= 200ms (for write-back mode)

### When to use both

- DR (SnapMirror) + daily read performance (FlexCache) at different sites
- Primary: SnapMirror for full protection; secondary: FlexCache for hot data acceleration

## Supported Multi-Cloud Paths

| Source | Destination | SnapMirror | FlexCache | Notes |
|--------|------------|:----------:|:---------:|-------|
| FSx for ONTAP | FSx for ONTAP (same region) | Yes | Yes | Simplest |
| FSx for ONTAP | FSx for ONTAP (cross-region) | Yes | Yes | VPC Peering required |
| FSx for ONTAP | On-premises ONTAP | Yes | Yes | Direct Connect / VPN |
| FSx for ONTAP | CVO on GCP | Yes | Yes | Cross-cloud VPN |
| FSx for ONTAP | CVO on Azure | Yes | Yes | Cross-cloud VPN |
| FSx for ONTAP | GCNV | Yes | Cache only | External Replication |
| FSx for ONTAP | ANF | — | — | Not supported directly |

## Version Requirements

| Feature | Minimum ONTAP | Notes |
|---------|:-------------:|-------|
| S3 Access Point (basic) | 9.14.1 | FSx for ONTAP feature |
| S3 NAS bucket (multiprotocol) | 9.12.1 | Underlying mechanism |
| SnapMirror Async | 9.11.1 | FSx for ONTAP baseline |
| FlexCache write-back | 9.15.1 | Both Origin and Cache |
| Recommended | **9.17.1+** | All features validated |

## Failover Procedure Summary

```
1. Break SnapMirror relationship (ONTAP REST API or FSx API)
2. Set junction path on destination volume (if not already set)
3. Poll FSx API until VolumeType = RW (~60 seconds)
4. Create new S3 Access Point on destination volume
5. Update client applications with new S3 AP ARN/alias
6. Verify NFS/SMB access on destination (pre-configured SVM)
```
