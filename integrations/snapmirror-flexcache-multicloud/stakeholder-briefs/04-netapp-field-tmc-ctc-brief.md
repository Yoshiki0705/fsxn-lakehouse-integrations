## Purpose

Quick-reference for field engagements where customers ask about combining FSx for ONTAP S3 Access Points with SnapMirror or FlexCache for multi-cloud data distribution. Focus on constraints, recommended configurations, and common pitfalls.

---

## One-Sentence Summary

FSx for ONTAP S3 AP-attached volumes support SnapMirror Async and FlexCache (validated on 9.17.1) — use volume-level SnapMirror (not SVM-DR) and design for non-overlapping file sets if combining S3 AP ingestion with FlexCache write-back.

---

## Quick Decision Matrix

| Customer asks... | Answer | Reference |
|-----------------|--------|-----------|
| "Can I SnapMirror an S3 AP volume?" | Yes — Async, volume-level only | SM-001 |
| "Does SVM-DR work with S3 AP?" | No — use volume-level SnapMirror | SM-004 |
| "Can I FlexCache an S3 AP volume?" | Yes — Origin 9.12.1+, Cache any compatible | FC-001 |
| "Does write-back work with S3 AP?" | Yes, with caveat: avoid same-file S3+Cache writes | FC-004 |
| "Can I replicate to ANF?" | No — use CVO on Azure as intermediary | XC-007 |
| "Can I replicate to GCNV?" | Yes — External Replication (SnapMirror) or FlexCache Cache | XC-006 |
| "Is SnapMirror Sync supported?" | No — Async only for S3 NAS bucket volumes | SM-001 |
| "What about failover to the destination?" | Break → wait 60s (FSx API) → create new S3 AP | SM-005 |

## Top 3 Constraints to Communicate Early

### 1. SVM-DR is NOT supported (SM-004)

**What to tell the customer:**
> "When your SVM has S3 Access Points configured, you need to use volume-level SnapMirror for data protection. SVM-level DR (SVM-DR) is not supported because the S3 NAS bucket configuration cannot be replicated at the SVM level. Pre-configure the destination SVM's protocol settings (CIFS, export policies, name-mappings) separately."

**Common misconception:** Customers assume SVM-DR handles everything. Clarify that volume data is protected, but SVM configuration requires separate management.

### 2. S3 AP does NOT "move" on failover (SM-005)

**What to tell the customer:**
> "S3 Access Points are AWS-layer constructs — they don't travel with SnapMirror. After failover (SnapMirror break), you create a new S3 AP on the destination volume. The new AP gets a new ARN and alias. Applications must be updated to use the new endpoint."

**Failover sequence:**
1. SnapMirror break
2. Wait ~60s for FSx API to show `VolumeType: RW`
3. `aws fsx create-and-attach-s3-access-point` on destination volume
4. Update application S3 endpoint configuration

### 3. FlexCache write-back + S3 AP requires file-set separation (FC-004)

**What to tell the customer:**
> "If you're using FlexCache write-back AND S3 AP ingestion on the same Origin volume, ensure they operate on different files. S3 writes to Origin trigger XLD revoke — if the Cache has uncommitted writes to the same file, that data is lost (Origin wins). Separate by directory path or file naming convention."

**Safe patterns:**
- `/data/ingestion/` (S3 AP writes) + `/data/analysis/` (Cache NFS writes) → Safe
- Same file from both paths → Data loss risk

## Version Compatibility Reference

| Configuration | Source ONTAP | Destination ONTAP | Key Constraint |
|--------------|:-----------:|:-----------------:|----------------|
| SnapMirror (FSx → FSx) | 9.11.1+ | 9.11.1+ | Same or ±1 major version |
| SnapMirror (FSx → On-prem) | 9.11.1+ | Compatibility matrix | Check NetApp IMT |
| SnapMirror (FSx → CVO) | 9.11.1+ | CVO latest | Auto-updated |
| FlexCache (Origin → Cache) | 9.12.1+ | Within 4 minor versions | Origin must be >= Cache |
| FlexCache write-back | 9.15.1+ | 9.15.1+ | Both sides required |

## Common Pitfalls in Customer Engagements

| Pitfall | Correction |
|---------|-----------|
| "S3 AP is like a separate bucket service" | S3 AP is a lens on a FlexVol. The volume is the data. S3 AP provides S3 API access to that volume. |
| "SnapMirror will copy the S3 AP configuration" | No. S3 AP is AWS-layer. Data replicates; S3 AP must be recreated at destination. |
| "We'll use SVM-DR for everything" | Not possible with S3 NAS bucket. Use volume-level + manual SVM config. |
| "FlexCache write-back handles everything" | Write-back is powerful but needs file-set separation when combined with S3 AP Origin writes. |
| "ANF is a valid SnapMirror destination" | Not currently. Route to CVO on Azure. GCNV works via External Replication. |
| "SnapMirror Sync for zero RPO" | Not supported for S3 NAS bucket volumes. Minimum RPO = SnapMirror schedule interval. |
