# Snowpipe + FSx for ONTAP S3 Access Point — Verification Results

**Measured**: 2026-08-05 | **Region**: ap-northeast-1

This document records what has actually been measured about ingesting data into
Snowflake from an FSx for ONTAP S3 Access Point, and — equally important — what
has not. It exists because several figures previously quoted in this repository
carried no evidence record, and one of them turned out not to be reproducible.

Raw evidence:

- [`verification-pack/s3ap-list-latency/evidence/2026-08-05/`](../../../../verification-pack/s3ap-list-latency/evidence/2026-08-05/benchmark-result.yaml)

## Executive Summary

**Snowpipe cannot be scheduled.** Snowpipe is event-driven by design; there is no
"run Snowpipe every 5 minutes" option. Scheduled ingestion from an FSx for ONTAP
S3 Access Point is done with a **Snowflake Task running COPY INTO**, which is a
different feature and is already verified.

| Ingestion path | Status | Evidence |
|---|:---:|---|
| Snowpipe auto-ingest (`AUTO_INGEST = TRUE`, real S3 events) | ❌ Not possible | S3 Event Notifications not supported on FSx for ONTAP S3 AP ([BLK-003](../../../../docs/en/blocker-tracker.md)) |
| **Task + COPY INTO (scheduled)** | ✅ **Verified** | COPY INTO from an AP-backed stage: [2026-05-24](../../../../verification-pack/snowflake/evidence/2026-05-24/evidence-record.yaml) |
| Task + `ALTER EXTERNAL TABLE ... REFRESH` | ✅ Verified | External Table read verified 2026-05-24 |
| Pattern A: Lambda polling → SNS → Snowpipe | ⚠️ AWS side verified, Snowflake leg **not** verified | [This document](#pattern-a-lambda-polling--sns) |
| Pattern B: FPolicy → Lambda → SNS → Snowpipe | ⚠️ Design only | No live verification |
| Snowpipe REST API (`insertFiles`) | ⚠️ Not verified | Documented as an option only |

**If you need scheduled ingestion today, use Task + COPY INTO.** It requires no
synthesized notification, and Snowflake's own load history gives you
exactly-once behaviour that a polling window cannot.

## Correction: the "30-80x slower ListObjectsV2" figure

This repository previously stated in about a dozen places that ListObjectsV2
against an FSx for ONTAP S3 Access Point is **30-80x slower** than native S3.
That figure was re-measured and **could not be reproduced**.

Measured medians, five recorded trials per data point, one discarded warm-up
call, timing scoped to the paginated ListObjectsV2 loop only:

| Objects | FSx for ONTAP S3 AP | Native S3 | Ratio |
|--------:|--------------------:|----------:|------:|
| 10 | 38 ms | 27 ms | 1.4x |
| 100 | 52 ms | 39 ms | 1.3x |
| 1,000 | 162 ms | 128 ms | 1.3x |
| 5,000 | 665 ms | 704 ms | 0.9x |

A nested layout (two directory levels, 10 objects per leaf, emulating
date-partitioned data) produced 1.4x at 1,000 objects and 1.0x at 5,000 — no
material difference from the flat layout.

**What this does and does not mean.** At the object counts tested the Access
Point performed within roughly 1.4x of native S3, comfortably inside the
performance targets previously recorded for this blocker (<1 s for <100 files,
<3 s for <1,000 files). It does **not** mean listing scales indefinitely: this
measurement stopped at 5,000 objects, and behaviour at hundreds of thousands or
millions of objects in a single directory remains untested. Design guidance to
consolidate small files and partition the key space still stands on those
grounds.

The origin of the 30-80x figure is not determined. No evidence record survives
to compare against, so it is recorded as unexplained rather than attributed to a
specific cause. Possible contributors include measurement through a CLI wrapper
(process startup dominates short calls), a file system in a degraded state at
the time, or platform changes between then and now.

> **Request-cost note**: with `MaxKeys=1000`, native S3 returned 1,000 keys in a
> single API call while the Access Point needed two, and six versus five at
> 5,000 objects. Wall-clock time stayed comparable, so this is not a bottleneck,
> but do not assume identical request counts when estimating API cost or when a
> client caps pagination depth.

Reproduce:

```bash
python3 shared/scripts/benchmark_list_objects.py \
  --ap-arn arn:aws:s3:<region>:<account>:accesspoint/<ap-name> \
  --native-bucket <comparison-bucket> \
  --counts 10,100,1000,5000 --trials 5 --layout flat --teardown
```

## Pattern A: Lambda polling → SNS

Pattern A works around the missing S3 Event Notifications by having a scheduled
Lambda list the Access Point, synthesize an S3-event-shaped notification, and
publish it to SNS, which then feeds the Snowflake-managed SQS queue backing a
pipe with `AUTO_INGEST = TRUE`.

The AWS half of that chain was verified. The Snowflake half was not, because no
Snowflake credentials were available in this environment.

### What passed

| Step | Result |
|---|---|
| PutObject to the Access Point (74-byte object) | 716-805 ms |
| Poller Lambda ListObjectsV2 detection | 981 ms wall time |
| SNS publish and delivery | Confirmed by capturing the message on a subscribed SQS queue |
| File write → notification delivered | **2.1 s** |
| Access Point addressing | Both ARN and alias work as the `Bucket` parameter; IAM granted on the AP ARN also authorizes alias-addressed requests |

The 2.1 s figure excludes the EventBridge schedule wait. Real-world detection
lag is (schedule interval) + ~2 s, so a `rate(5 minutes)` schedule means up to
about five minutes — consistent with the "5-7 min" design target quoted for the
polling approach.

### Defects found

Verification surfaced six defects. Two of them prevent the published artifacts
from working as shipped.

| ID | Severity | Issue |
|---|---|---|
| DEFECT-1 | High | `snowpipe-lambda/template.yaml` deploys a placeholder function, not the real handler |
| DEFECT-2 | High | Objects older than the polling window are silently never notified (data loss) |
| DEFECT-3 | Medium | Synthesized notification omits fields present in real S3 events |
| DEFECT-4 | Medium | `s3.bucket.name` carries an ARN when the AP ARN is configured |
| DEFECT-5 | Low | Overlapping windows re-notify already-notified objects |
| DEFECT-6 | Low | No dead-letter queue and no error alarm on the poller |

**DEFECT-1** — the template's inline `Code.ZipFile` body is
`return {"statusCode": 200, "body": "Deploy handler.py"}`. Deploying the
template as published yields a poller that never lists anything. `handler.py`
exceeds the inline size limit, so it cannot simply be pasted in; a real
packaging step is required. The template declares
`Transform: AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31` but defines no SAM resources, so the
transform is currently inert.

**DEFECT-2** — when `STATE_TABLE` is unset the cutoff is
`now - POLLING_INTERVAL_MINUTES`, and because that cutoff tracks wall clock, any
object older than the window is never revisited. Reproduced: an object written
at 05:07:52Z was invisible to an invocation at 05:09:33Z whose cutoff was
05:08:33Z — `new_files_found=0`, while ListObjectsV2 on the same prefix
confirmed the object was present. Aggravating factor: `template.yaml` exposes no
`STATE_TABLE` parameter at all, so every CloudFormation-deployed poller runs in
exactly this lossy mode and the DynamoDB checkpoint path in `handler.py` is
unreachable through the published template.

**DEFECT-3 / DEFECT-4** — the synthesized record carries only `eventVersion`,
`eventSource`, `eventName`, `eventTime`, `s3.bucket.name`, `s3.object.key` and
`s3.object.size`. A genuine S3 notification also carries `awsRegion`,
`s3.s3SchemaVersion`, `s3.configurationId`, `s3.bucket.ownerIdentity`,
`s3.bucket.arn`, `s3.object.eTag` and `s3.object.sequencer`. Separately,
`handler.py` copies `S3_ACCESS_POINT_ALIAS` straight into `s3.bucket.name`, so
supplying the AP ARN emits an ARN where a bucket name belongs. Since Snowpipe
matches an incoming notification against its pipe's stage location, an ARN there
is unlikely to match a stage URL of the form `s3://<bucket>/<path>`.

### What remains unverified

The deciding question is whether Snowflake accepts a **synthesized** notification
on a pipe's `notification_channel` and triggers COPY. Everything upstream of that
now has evidence; that one step does not. Until it is tested, Pattern A should
not be presented as a working path.

Testing it requires a Snowflake account with `ACCOUNTADMIN` (to create the
storage integration and pipe) plus the AWS side redeployed with DEFECT-1 through
DEFECT-4 addressed. `integrations/snowflake/tests/test_snowpipe_e2e.sh` is the
intended harness and additionally needs an NFS mount of the volume.

## Constraints that apply to every path

These are unchanged by this round of verification and remain the practical
limits on ingesting FSx for ONTAP data into Snowflake.

| Constraint | Effect |
|---|---|
| No S3 Event Notifications | Snowpipe auto-ingest and `AUTO_REFRESH` are unavailable ([BLK-003](../../../../docs/en/blocker-tracker.md)) |
| No `AUTO_REFRESH` | External Table and Directory Table metadata need an explicit `REFRESH`, typically driven by a Task |
| No conditional writes | Iceberg / Delta write-back is blocked ([BLK-002](../../../../docs/en/blocker-tracker.md)) |
| PutObject 5 GB ceiling | Larger objects need multipart upload within that limit |
| `TO_FILE()` unsupported on AP stages | Vision AI needs a `COPY FILES` staging step |
| Not officially supported by Snowflake | Snowflake does not document FSx for ONTAP S3 Access Points as a supported External Stage backend. Read and governance paths are verified here, but consult Snowflake Support before production use |

> **Dynamic Table note**: a Dynamic Table sourced from an External Table needs
> `REFRESH_MODE = FULL` (incremental refresh requires change tracking, which
> External Tables do not provide) and a minimum `TARGET_LAG` of 60 seconds. It
> also still depends on a Task to refresh the External Table metadata first,
> because `AUTO_REFRESH` is unavailable.
