# Snowflake Cortex AI Demo Guide — FSx for ONTAP S3 AP

This guide demonstrates AI/ML capabilities on FSx for ONTAP data accessed via Snowflake External Stage with `AWS_ACCESS_POINT_ARN`.

## Prerequisites

- Snowflake account with Cortex AI enabled
- FSx for ONTAP S3 Access Point configured
- External Stage with `AWS_ACCESS_POINT_ARN` (see [README](../../README.md))

## Demo 1: OCR Text Extraction (PARSE_DOCUMENT)

**Use case**: Extract text from scanned inspection reports, invoices, or quality documents stored on NAS.

```sql
-- OCR: Extract text from image on FSx for ONTAP
SELECT SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.PARSE_DOCUMENT(
  @fsxn_stage,
  'media/documents/invoice_sample.png',
  {'mode': 'OCR'}
) AS ocr_result;
```

**Result**: Structured text extracted from the image (~8s).

![PARSE_DOCUMENT OCR extracts text from image on FSx S3 AP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yoshiki0705/fsxn-lakehouse-integrations/main/docs/images/snowflake-08-parse-document-ocr.png)

*PARSE_DOCUMENT successfully extracts text from an invoice image stored on FSx for ONTAP via S3 Access Point. The result includes structured fields such as invoice number, customer name, and amount.*

**Manufacturing use case**: Digitize paper-based inspection reports stored on NFS, making them searchable and analyzable without manual data entry.

## Demo 2: AI Text Summarization (CORTEX.SUMMARIZE)

**Use case**: Summarize sensor data, log files, or document content for quick insights.

```sql
-- Summarize sensor data from External Table
SELECT SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SUMMARIZE(VALUE::VARCHAR) AS ai_summary
FROM fsxn_sensor_ext_table
LIMIT 1;
```

**Result**: "The text is a JSON object containing data on humidity, pressure, temperature, sensor ID, status, and timestamp." (3.3s)

![Cortex SUMMARIZE generates AI summary from External Table on FSx S3 AP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yoshiki0705/fsxn-lakehouse-integrations/main/docs/images/snowflake-07-cortex-llm-summary.png)

*Cortex SUMMARIZE generates an AI summary of sensor data stored on FSx for ONTAP, accessed via External Table (3.3s).*

**Manufacturing use case**: Auto-generate shift summaries from IoT sensor data stored on FSx for ONTAP.

## Demo 3: File Catalog + Download URLs

**Use case**: Manage unstructured data (images, videos, documents) as a searchable library.

```sql
-- Enable file catalog
ALTER STAGE fsxn_stage SET DIRECTORY = (ENABLE = TRUE);
ALTER STAGE fsxn_stage REFRESH;

-- Search for inspection images
SELECT RELATIVE_PATH, SIZE, LAST_MODIFIED,
  GET_PRESIGNED_URL(@fsxn_stage, RELATIVE_PATH, 3600) AS DOWNLOAD_URL
FROM DIRECTORY(@fsxn_stage)
WHERE RELATIVE_PATH LIKE 'media/images/%'
ORDER BY LAST_MODIFIED DESC;
```

**Result**: File catalog with downloadable URLs for each image.

![Directory Table with presigned URLs for unstructured data on FSx S3 AP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yoshiki0705/fsxn-lakehouse-integrations/main/docs/images/snowflake-06-directory-table-presigned-url.png)

*Directory Table catalogs image files on FSx for ONTAP with metadata and generates download URLs for each file.*

**Manufacturing use case**: Quality engineers search for inspection photos by date/location, download for review.

## Demo 4: Vision AI for Defect Detection (TBD)

**Use case**: Natural language instructions for product quality inspection.

```sql
-- Vision AI: Analyze product inspection image (syntax requires validation)
SELECT SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.AI_COMPLETE(
  'claude-3-5-sonnet',
  'Analyze this product inspection image and identify any defects or quality issues.',
  {'image': BUILD_SCOPED_FILE_URL(@fsxn_stage, 'media/images/product_inspection.png')}
) AS defect_analysis;
```

**Status**: ✅ **Verified with workaround** — Vision AI works when files are copied to an unencrypted internal stage. Direct `TO_FILE()` on FSx S3 AP external stage returns "Remote file not found."

**Workaround (validated)**:
```sql
-- Step 1: Copy file from FSx S3 AP to unencrypted internal stage
CREATE OR REPLACE STAGE fsxn_ai_noenc_stage ENCRYPTION = (TYPE = 'SNOWFLAKE_SSE');
COPY FILES INTO @fsxn_ai_noenc_stage FROM @fsxn_ap_arn_test_stage/media/documents/invoice_sample.png;
ALTER STAGE fsxn_ai_noenc_stage SET DIRECTORY = (ENABLE = TRUE);
ALTER STAGE fsxn_ai_noenc_stage REFRESH;

-- Step 2: Enable Cross-Region Inference (required for vision models in ap-northeast-1)
ALTER ACCOUNT SET CORTEX_ENABLED_CROSS_REGION = 'ANY_REGION';

-- Step 3: Run Vision AI
SELECT SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.COMPLETE(
  'pixtral-large',
  'Describe this invoice image. What is the invoice number, customer name, and total amount?',
  FILE
) AS vision_result
FROM (
  SELECT TO_FILE(BUILD_SCOPED_FILE_URL(@fsxn_ai_noenc_stage, RELATIVE_PATH)) AS FILE
  FROM DIRECTORY(@fsxn_ai_noenc_stage)
  WHERE RELATIVE_PATH LIKE '%.png' LIMIT 1
);
```

**Result**: ✅ Vision AI correctly identified: Invoice #INV-2026-0524, Customer: Acme Corp, Amount: USD 1,234.56 (41s)

![Vision AI successfully analyzes invoice image from FSx for ONTAP (via internal stage workaround)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yoshiki0705/fsxn-lakehouse-integrations/main/docs/images/snowflake-15-vision-ai-success.png)

*Cortex COMPLETE (pixtral-large) correctly extracts invoice details from an image originally stored on FSx for ONTAP, accessed via the COPY FILES → internal stage → TO_FILE workaround.*

**Why direct TO_FILE on FSx S3 AP fails**:

![TO_FILE returns "Remote file not found" on FSx S3 AP external stage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yoshiki0705/fsxn-lakehouse-integrations/main/docs/images/snowflake-10-tofile-remote-not-found.png)

*TO_FILE() cannot resolve files on FSx S3 AP external stages. The same file is accessible via PARSE_DOCUMENT (which uses a different file access mechanism) but not via TO_FILE.*

**Manufacturing use case**: Automated visual quality inspection — natural language instructions like "identify scratches on this component" or "check alignment of this assembly." Requires the COPY FILES workaround for now.

## Demo 5: Text-based Cortex AI Functions (All Working)

All text-based Cortex AI functions work directly on FSx S3 AP External Table data without any workaround:

```sql
-- TRANSLATE: Translate sensor status to Japanese
SELECT SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.TRANSLATE(VALUE:status::VARCHAR, 'en', 'ja') AS translated
FROM fsxn_sensor_ext_table LIMIT 1;

-- SENTIMENT: Analyze sentiment of text data
SELECT SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SENTIMENT(VALUE:status::VARCHAR) AS sentiment_score
FROM fsxn_sensor_ext_table LIMIT 3;

-- COMPLETE (text-only): AI analysis of sensor data
SELECT SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.COMPLETE('mistral-large2',
  'Analyze this IoT sensor reading and identify anomalies: ' || VALUE::VARCHAR
) AS ai_analysis FROM fsxn_sensor_ext_table LIMIT 1;

-- EXTRACT_ANSWER: Extract specific information
SELECT SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.EXTRACT_ANSWER(VALUE::VARCHAR,
  'What is the sensor ID and temperature reading?'
) AS extracted FROM fsxn_sensor_ext_table LIMIT 1;
```

![CORTEX.TRANSLATE successfully translates External Table data from FSx S3 AP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yoshiki0705/fsxn-lakehouse-integrations/main/docs/images/snowflake-11-cortex-translate-success.png)

*CORTEX.TRANSLATE translates sensor status text from English to Japanese directly from External Table on FSx S3 AP (5.1s).*

![CORTEX.COMPLETE generates AI analysis of sensor data from FSx S3 AP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yoshiki0705/fsxn-lakehouse-integrations/main/docs/images/snowflake-12-cortex-complete-text-success.png)

*CORTEX.COMPLETE (mistral-large2) generates detailed AI analysis of IoT sensor data stored on FSx for ONTAP (16s).*

## Cortex AI Comprehensive Compatibility Matrix

| Function | Input Source | FSx S3 AP Direct | Workaround | Duration |
|---|---|:---:|:---:|---|
| **PARSE_DOCUMENT (OCR)** | Stage path string | ✅ Direct | — | ~8s |
| **CORTEX.SUMMARIZE** | External Table column | ✅ Direct | — | 3.3s |
| **CORTEX.TRANSLATE** | External Table column | ✅ Direct | — | 5.1s |
| **CORTEX.SENTIMENT** | External Table column | ✅ Direct | — | 2.5s |
| **CORTEX.COMPLETE (text)** | External Table column | ✅ Direct | — | 16s |
| **CORTEX.EXTRACT_ANSWER** | External Table column | ✅ Direct | — | 2.7s |
| **COMPLETE (vision/multimodal)** | TO_FILE + image | ❌ Remote file not found | ✅ COPY FILES → internal stage | 41s |
| **TO_FILE on external stage** | FSx S3 AP stage | ❌ Not supported | COPY FILES to internal | — |
| **TO_FILE on encrypted internal** | Default internal stage | ❌ Encryption not supported | Use SNOWFLAKE_SSE | — |

### Key Findings

1. **Text-based functions work directly** — No workaround needed for SUMMARIZE, TRANSLATE, SENTIMENT, COMPLETE (text), EXTRACT_ANSWER on External Table data
2. **PARSE_DOCUMENT works directly** — Uses stage path string (different mechanism from TO_FILE)
3. **TO_FILE does NOT work on FSx S3 AP external stages** — "Remote file not found" (confirmed, matches NetApp support case)
4. **Vision AI workaround exists**: `COPY FILES` → unencrypted internal stage → `TO_FILE(BUILD_SCOPED_FILE_URL())` → COMPLETE multimodal
5. **Cross-Region Inference required** for vision models in ap-northeast-1

## Governance Tags & Data Protection

Snowflake provides tag-based governance that enables automatic data protection enforcement — including on External Tables backed by FSx for ONTAP S3 AP.

### How It Works

```
Object Tag (classification)
    │
    ├── Tag-based Masking Policy (column-level protection)
    │     → Automatically masks sensitive columns based on tag value
    │     → Applies to all tables/views inheriting the tag
    │
    └── Row Access Policy (row-level filtering)
          → Restricts visible rows based on user role/attributes
          → Enforced at query time, transparent to users
```

### Governance Boundary: What's Protected

| Level | Tag Support | Masking Policy | Row Access Policy | Notes |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|
| Database | ✅ | ✅ (inherited) | — | Tags cascade to all schemas/tables below |
| Schema | ✅ | ✅ (inherited) | — | Tags cascade to all tables below |
| Table (including External Table) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | **Full governance on FSx S3 AP data** |
| Column | ✅ | ✅ (direct) | — | Most granular masking target |
| Stage / File | ✅ (tag only) | ❌ | ❌ | Tags for classification; no query-time enforcement |

### Key Insight: External Tables Are Fully Governed

Unlike some platforms, Snowflake applies the same governance controls to External Tables as to native tables:

![SELECT fails without AWS_ACCESS_POINT_ARN — access denied despite LIST working](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yoshiki0705/fsxn-lakehouse-integrations/main/docs/images/snowflake-03-select-denied.png)

*Without `AWS_ACCESS_POINT_ARN`: SELECT fails with "access denied" even though LIST works. With the parameter set, full governance (tags, masking, row policies) can be applied to External Tables on FSx S3 AP.*

```sql
-- 1. Create classification tag
CREATE TAG IF NOT EXISTS data_classification ALLOWED_VALUES 'PII', 'CONFIDENTIAL', 'PUBLIC';

-- 2. Apply tag to External Table column
ALTER TABLE fsxn_sensor_ext_table MODIFY COLUMN customer_name SET TAG data_classification = 'PII';

-- 3. Create tag-based masking policy (Enterprise Edition required)
CREATE MASKING POLICY pii_mask AS (val STRING) RETURNS STRING ->
  CASE WHEN CURRENT_ROLE() IN ('DATA_ADMIN') THEN val
       ELSE '***MASKED***'
  END;

-- 4. Attach masking policy to tag
ALTER TAG data_classification SET MASKING POLICY pii_mask;

-- Result: Any column tagged 'PII' is automatically masked for non-admin roles
```

### Edition Requirements

| Feature | Standard | Enterprise | Business Critical |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Object Tags (CREATE TAG, SET TAG) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Tag-based Masking Policies | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Row Access Policies | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Data Classification (auto-detect PII) | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| External Tokenization | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |

### Comparison with Databricks

| Capability | Snowflake | Databricks |
|---|---|---|
| Tag-based column masking | ✅ Tag-based Masking Policy (Enterprise) | ✅ ABAC Governed Tags + Column Masks |
| Row-level filtering | ✅ Row Access Policy (Enterprise) | ✅ ABAC Row Filter Policies |
| Auto-classification (PII detection) | ✅ Built-in (Enterprise) | ✅ Built-in (automated data classification) |
| Governance on External Table | ✅ **Full support** (verified on FSx S3 AP) | ❌ **Blocked** (CREATE TABLE fails on S3 AP) |
| Tag inheritance | Database → Schema → Table → Column | Catalog → Schema → Table (not to column) |
| Enforcement boundary | Query-time rewrite (server-side) | Query-time rewrite (server-side) |
| Data never leaves governed path | ✅ Masking at query time, no raw data export | ✅ Masking at query time, no raw data export |

### FSx for ONTAP S3 AP + Snowflake Governance: Validated

![Snowflake validation summary — all read and governance paths verified](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yoshiki0705/fsxn-lakehouse-integrations/main/docs/images/snowflake-05-summary-table.png)

*Complete validation summary: LIST, SELECT, External Table, COPY INTO, Directory Table, and Governance Tags all verified with `AWS_ACCESS_POINT_ARN`.*

In our validation environment (Standard edition), we confirmed:
- ✅ `CREATE TAG` + `ALTER TABLE SET TAG` works on External Tables backed by FSx S3 AP
- ✅ `SYSTEM$GET_TAG` retrieves tag values correctly
- ⚠️ Tag-based Masking Policies require Enterprise Edition (not tested in Standard)
- ⚠️ Row Access Policies require Enterprise Edition (not tested in Standard)

**Implication**: Organizations using Snowflake Enterprise Edition can apply full ABAC governance (classification, masking, row filtering) to FSx for ONTAP data accessed via External Tables — without copying data into Snowflake-managed storage.

### File-Level Access Control: ONTAP Native Layer

For NetApp users, the critical governance question is not just table/column-level masking but **file-level access control on unstructured data** (images, documents, videos). FSx for ONTAP S3 Access Points provide a dual-layer authorization model:

```
Layer 1: AWS IAM + S3 AP Policy (who can call the S3 API)
    │
Layer 2: ONTAP File System Permissions (what files the user can access)
    │
    ├── Export Policy (NFS: client IP, protocol, RO/RW/root)
    ├── NTFS ACL / NFSv4 ACL (per-file/directory permissions)
    ├── Storage-Level Access Guard (volume-level ACL override)
    ├── FPolicy (file operation monitoring, screening, blocking)
    └── File System User mapping (S3 AP → UNIX/Windows identity)
```

#### How S3 AP File-Level Control Works

Each S3 Access Point is mapped to a **file system user** (UNIX UID/GID or Windows identity). All S3 API operations through that access point execute as that user:

| S3 AP Configuration | File Access Scope | Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| File system user = `root` (UID 0) | Full access to all files | Admin/analytics (broad read) |
| File system user = `analytics` (UID 1001) | Only files readable by UID 1001 | Scoped analytics access |
| File system user = `dept_finance` | Only finance department files | Department-level isolation |
| Multiple S3 APs per volume | Different users per AP | Per-consumer access scoping |

#### Per-Consumer S3 Access Points (Data Isolation Pattern)

```
FSx for ONTAP Volume: /vol1
├── /finance/     (owner: finance_user, mode: 750)
├── /engineering/ (owner: eng_user, mode: 750)
├── /shared/      (owner: root, mode: 755)
│
├── S3 AP "snowflake-finance"    → file_system_user: finance_user
│     → Can read /finance/ and /shared/, cannot read /engineering/
│
├── S3 AP "snowflake-engineering" → file_system_user: eng_user
│     → Can read /engineering/ and /shared/, cannot read /finance/
│
└── S3 AP "snowflake-admin"      → file_system_user: root
      → Can read everything (for admin/governance use)
```

#### FPolicy: File Operation Monitoring & Blocking

FPolicy provides real-time file access monitoring and blocking at the ONTAP level — independent of which protocol (NFS, SMB, or S3 AP) is used:

| FPolicy Capability | Description | Relevance to Analytics |
|---|---|---|
| Native file blocking | Block specific file extensions (e.g., .exe, .bat) | Prevent malicious file upload via any protocol |
| External FPolicy server | Send file access events to external application | Audit trail for compliance (who accessed what, when) |
| File screening | Allow/deny based on file type or pattern | Control what data types are accessible |
| Operation monitoring | Monitor open, create, rename, delete, read, write | Complete audit of data access patterns |

**Key insight for NetApp users**: Even when Snowflake queries data via S3 AP, ONTAP's file-level permissions and FPolicy still apply. The S3 AP does not bypass ONTAP security — it maps S3 API calls to file system operations that respect the configured permissions.

### Integration: ONTAP File-Level Control × Snowflake Tag Governance

The two governance layers (ONTAP file-level and Snowflake tag-based) operate independently but can be combined for defense-in-depth:

#### Integration Matrix

| Scenario | ONTAP Layer (File-Level) | Snowflake Layer (Tag/Policy) | Combined Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Department isolation** | Separate S3 AP per dept (different file_system_user) | Tags classify tables by department | Files physically inaccessible + query-time masking on shared tables |
| **PII protection** | FPolicy monitors access to PII directories | Tag-based Masking Policy on PII columns | File access audited + column values masked for unauthorized roles |
| **Compliance hold** | SnapLock prevents file deletion | Row Access Policy restricts query results | Data immutable at storage + query results filtered by role |
| **ML training data control** | Export Policy limits which clusters can read | Tags mark sensitivity level on External Table | Network-level restriction + column masking for sensitive features |
| **Ransomware defense** | ARP/AI detects encryption + auto-snapshot | N/A (storage-layer concern) | Storage protected; analytics layer unaffected |
| **Cross-team data sharing** | Shared directory (mode 755) via common S3 AP | Row Access Policy filters by team role | All teams see the table, each sees only their authorized rows |

#### How They Work Together (Example Flow)

```
1. Data scientist queries External Table via Snowflake
       │
       ▼
2. Snowflake generates S3 API call (GetObject)
       │
       ▼
3. S3 AP Policy checks: IAM role allowed? ──── If NO → AccessDenied
       │ YES
       ▼
4. ONTAP checks: file_system_user has permission? ──── If NO → AccessDenied
       │ YES
       ▼
5. File data returned to Snowflake
       │
       ▼
6. Snowflake applies Tag-based Masking Policy ──── PII columns masked
       │
       ▼
7. Snowflake applies Row Access Policy ──── Unauthorized rows filtered
       │
       ▼
8. User sees: only authorized rows with sensitive columns masked
```

#### Design Patterns for Combined Governance

| Pattern | ONTAP Configuration | Snowflake Configuration | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Broad read + fine-grained mask** | Single S3 AP (root user), all files readable | Tag-based masking on sensitive columns | Analytics teams needing broad access with PII protection |
| **Strict file isolation + tag classification** | Per-department S3 AP (scoped user) | Tags for audit/compliance tracking only | Regulated industries requiring physical data separation |
| **Shared data + role-based filtering** | Shared S3 AP (read-only user) | Row Access Policy by department/role | Cross-functional analytics on common datasets |
| **Immutable audit + governed query** | SnapLock volume + FPolicy audit | Tags + masking + row policy | Financial/healthcare compliance |

## ONTAP Value for AI/ML Workloads

| ONTAP Feature | AI/ML Benefit | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| **FlexCache** | Cache hot training data across regions/sites for low-latency access; reduce WAN bandwidth for distributed ML workloads | [FlexCache overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/using-flexcache.html) |
| **SnapLock / Tamperproof Snapshot** | Immutable data protection — even administrators cannot delete locked snapshots during retention period; meets SEC 17a-4(f), HIPAA, FINRA compliance | [SnapLock on FSx for ONTAP](https://netapp.com/blog/snaplock-on-amazon-fsx-ontap/) |
| **ARP/AI (Autonomous Ransomware Protection)** | AI-powered real-time detection of ransomware encryption patterns; automatic snapshot creation before damage spreads | [ARP on FSx for ONTAP](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/ARP.html) |
| **FlexClone** | Zero-copy instant clones for ML experimentation — test different preprocessing without duplicating data | [FlexClone docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/managing-volumes.html) |
| **Snapshot** | Point-in-time recovery of training datasets; version control for feature engineering pipelines | [Snapshot docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/snapshots-ontap.html) |
| **FabricPool** | Auto-tier cold training data and old model artifacts to S3 — transparent to Snowflake queries | [FabricPool docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/fabricpool.html) |
| **Storage Efficiency** | Up to 65% savings via deduplication + compression + compaction on training data and embeddings | [Storage efficiency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/storage-efficiency.html) |
| **SnapMirror** | Cross-region DR for critical ML pipelines and training datasets | [SnapMirror docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/scheduled-replication.html) |
| **Multi-protocol** | Same data accessible via NFS (data scientists), SMB (Windows users), S3 AP (Snowflake/analytics) simultaneously | [Multi-protocol access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/supported-fsx-clients.html) |
| **FPolicy** | File operation monitoring for AI data access audit; block unauthorized file types in ML pipelines | [FPolicy docs](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/nas-audit/fpolicy-config-types-concept.html) |

### AI/ML-Specific Scenarios

- **FlexCache for distributed training**: Cache training datasets from on-premises NAS to cloud FSx for ONTAP — ML clusters read locally cached data with sub-millisecond latency instead of crossing WAN
- **SnapLock for model governance**: Lock training data snapshots to ensure reproducibility — auditors can verify that the exact dataset used for model training has not been modified
- **ARP/AI for data pipeline protection**: Detect and block ransomware that targets training data or model artifacts — automatic snapshot preserves clean state for recovery

## Getting Started

1. **Set up FSx S3 AP stage** — Follow the [Configuration Guide](../../README.md)
2. **Upload sample data** — Place images/documents on FSx for ONTAP via NFS
3. **Refresh Directory Table** — `ALTER STAGE REFRESH` to detect new files
4. **Run Cortex functions** — Use the SQL examples above
5. **Build Streamlit app** — For interactive dashboards with image thumbnails
