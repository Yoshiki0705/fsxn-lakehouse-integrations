# Databricks AI/ML Demo Guide — FSx for ONTAP S3 AP

This guide documents AI/ML capabilities and their current status when accessing FSx for ONTAP data from Databricks via S3 Access Points.

> 📖 For a detailed comparison of **Managed Table vs External Table** including current limitations and recommended patterns, see the [Managed Table vs External Table Design Guide](../../README.md#managed-table-vs-external-table--design-guide).

> **Important**: Unity Catalog session policy currently blocks table creation and subdirectory listing on FSx for ONTAP S3 Access Points. The scenarios below document what works today (driver-only PoC), what's blocked, and what would be possible once the platform boundary is resolved.

## Prerequisites

- Databricks workspace on AWS (Customer-managed VPC recommended)
- FSx for ONTAP S3 Access Point configured
- Instance Profile with S3 AP access (for PoC path)
- Unity Catalog External Location with `access_point` field set
- DBR 17.3 LTS or later

## Current Status Summary

| Capability | Status | Path | Blocker |
|---|:---:|---|---|
| Spark file read (explicit path) | ✅ Works | UC External Location + `access_point` | — |
| Subdirectory listing | ❌ Blocked | UC External Location | Session policy prefix-level access |
| CREATE TABLE on S3 AP | ❌ Blocked | UC External Location | UC_CLOUD_STORAGE_ACCESS_FAILURE |
| boto3 file read (driver) | ✅ Works | Instance Profile (Customer VPC) | Bypasses UC governance |
| Feature Store table | ❌ Blocked | Requires CREATE TABLE | Session policy |
| MLflow tracking | ✅ Works | Independent of storage path | — |
| Model Serving | ⚠️ Not validated | Different credential path | — |

## Demo 1: Spark Read from FSx for ONTAP (Working)

**Use case**: Read structured data (CSV, Parquet) from FSx for ONTAP for ML feature engineering.

```python
# Read sensor data from FSx for ONTAP via S3 AP (explicit file path)
df = spark.read.format("csv") \
    .option("header", "true") \
    .option("inferSchema", "true") \
    .load("s3://<s3ap-alias>/bronze/sensor_data/sensor_readings.csv")

df.show(5)
print(f"✅ Read {df.count()} rows from FSx for ONTAP S3 AP")
```

**Result**: 1000 rows read successfully from sensor CSV on FSx for ONTAP (explicit file path with `access_point` field set on External Location).

![Spark read succeeds for explicit file path on FSx S3 AP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yoshiki0705/fsxn-lakehouse-integrations/main/docs/images/databricks-ai-spark-read-success.png)

*Spark successfully reads sensor CSV data from FSx for ONTAP S3 Access Point using an explicit file path under Unity Catalog governance.*

**Limitation**: Only explicit file paths work. Directory-level reads (e.g., `spark.read.parquet("s3://<alias>/bronze/")`) fail because subdirectory listing is blocked by the session policy.

![Top-level listing succeeds — 287 items visible on FSx S3 AP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yoshiki0705/fsxn-lakehouse-integrations/main/docs/images/databricks-ls-success-287-items.png)

*Top-level `dbutils.fs.ls` succeeds with 287 items visible. However, subdirectory listing and table creation remain blocked.*

---

## Demo 2: CREATE TABLE — Blocked (Error Evidence)

**Use case**: Register FSx for ONTAP data as a governed Unity Catalog table for ML pipelines.

```sql
-- Attempt to create External Table on FSx for ONTAP S3 AP
CREATE TABLE fsxn_lakehouse.bronze.sensor_data
USING CSV
OPTIONS (header = 'true', inferSchema = 'true')
LOCATION 's3://<s3ap-alias>/bronze/sensor_data/';
```

**Result**: ❌ `UC_CLOUD_STORAGE_ACCESS_FAILURE` — Unity Catalog's internal validation cannot access the S3 AP path for table registration.

![CREATE TABLE blocked by UC session policy on FSx S3 AP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yoshiki0705/fsxn-lakehouse-integrations/main/docs/images/databricks-ai-create-table-blocked.png)

*Unity Catalog rejects table creation on FSx for ONTAP S3 Access Point. The session policy generated during AssumeRole does not include the S3 AP ARN pattern for internal validation operations.*

**Impact on AI/ML**: Without table creation, the following are blocked:
- Feature Store table registration
- Delta Lake managed tables for ML training data
- Unity Catalog lineage tracking for model training
- Column-level governance tags on training data

---

## Demo 3: Subdirectory Listing — Blocked (Error Evidence)

**Use case**: List files in a subdirectory for batch processing (image classification, document extraction).

```python
# Attempt to list subdirectory contents
files = dbutils.fs.ls("s3://<s3ap-alias>/media/images/")
```

**Result**: ❌ `AccessDenied` on `getFileStatus` — prefix-based ListObjectsV2 is blocked for subdirectories.

![Subdirectory listing blocked by session policy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yoshiki0705/fsxn-lakehouse-integrations/main/docs/images/databricks-ai-subdir-listing-blocked.png)

*Subdirectory listing fails with AccessDenied. The UC session policy allows top-level listing but blocks prefix-scoped ListObjectsV2 for subdirectories.*

**Impact on AI/ML**: Without subdirectory listing, batch processing patterns like `spark.read.format("binaryFile").load("s3://<alias>/media/images/")` cannot discover files automatically.

---

## Demo 4: Instance Profile + boto3 (PoC Path — Works)

**Use case**: Read unstructured data (images, documents) from FSx for ONTAP for AI processing.

```python
import boto3
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

# Read image from FSx for ONTAP via Instance Profile (bypasses UC)
s3 = boto3.client('s3', region_name='ap-northeast-1')
response = s3.get_object(
    Bucket='<s3ap-alias>',
    Key='media/images/inspection_photo.jpg'
)
img = Image.open(BytesIO(response['Body'].read()))
print(f"✅ Image loaded: {img.size}, {img.mode}")
```

**Result**: ✅ Image file read successfully from FSx for ONTAP S3 AP via Instance Profile on Customer-managed VPC (Dedicated cluster).

**⚠️ Governance warning**: This path bypasses Unity Catalog entirely. No lineage, no access control, no audit trail within Databricks. Use only for controlled PoC with explicit approval from data owner, security owner, and platform owner.

---

## Demo 5: MLflow Experiment Tracking (Works)

**Use case**: Track ML experiments that use FSx for ONTAP data as training source.

```python
import mlflow

# MLflow tracking works independently of storage path
with mlflow.start_run(run_name="fsxn_sensor_model"):
    mlflow.log_param("data_source", "fsxn_s3ap")
    mlflow.log_param("data_path", "s3://<s3ap-alias>/bronze/sensor_data/")
    mlflow.log_param("access_method", "instance_profile_boto3")

    # Train model using data read via boto3...
    # mlflow.log_metric("accuracy", 0.95)
    # mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "model")

    print("✅ MLflow experiment tracked")
```

**Result**: ✅ MLflow experiment tracking works regardless of how data is accessed. However, Unity Catalog lineage (which table → which model) is NOT captured when data is read via boto3.

**Best practice**: Even when using the boto3 PoC path, register trained models in Unity Catalog Model Registry for governance.

## Future Capabilities (When UC Session Policy Is Resolved)

Once Databricks resolves the Unity Catalog session policy boundary for S3 Access Points, the following AI/ML workflows would become available:

### Feature Store on FSx for ONTAP

```python
# FUTURE: Feature table on FSx for ONTAP (requires CREATE TABLE)
from databricks.feature_engineering import FeatureEngineeringClient

fe = FeatureEngineeringClient()
fe.create_table(
    name="fsxn_lakehouse.features.customer_features",
    primary_keys=["customer_id"],
    df=feature_df,
    description="Customer ML features stored on FSx for ONTAP"
)
```

### Image Embeddings with CLIP

```python
# FUTURE: Batch image processing (requires subdirectory listing)
images_df = spark.read.format("binaryFile") \
    .option("pathGlobFilter", "*.{jpg,png}") \
    .load("s3://<s3ap-alias>/media/images/")

# Generate CLIP embeddings
embeddings_df = images_df.withColumn(
    "embedding", generate_clip_embedding(col("content"))
)
```

### Document Processing for RAG

```python
# FUTURE: Document text extraction (requires binaryFile directory read)
docs_df = spark.read.format("binaryFile") \
    .option("pathGlobFilter", "*.{pdf,docx}") \
    .load("s3://<s3ap-alias>/media/documents/")

# Extract text, chunk, embed for RAG pipeline
```

### Mosaic AI Model Training

```python
# FUTURE: Governed model training with UC lineage
# Requires: UC table on S3 AP → training data → model → UC Model Registry
# Full lineage: data source → features → model → serving endpoint
```

---

## Governance Tags & Data Protection (ABAC)

Databricks Unity Catalog provides Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) using governed tags to enforce row-level and column-level security. However, this capability has specific requirements and limitations when used with FSx for ONTAP S3 Access Points.

### How It Works

```
Governed Tag (classification attribute)
    │
    ├── ABAC Column Mask Policy
    │     → Automatically masks columns matching tag conditions
    │     → Applies across catalog/schema scope
    │
    └── ABAC Row Filter Policy
          → Restricts visible rows based on tag + user attributes
          → Enforced at query time by Unity Catalog
```

### Governance Boundary: What's Protected

| Level | Tag Support | Column Mask | Row Filter | Notes |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|
| Catalog | ✅ | ✅ (ABAC scope) | ✅ (ABAC scope) | Tags cascade to schemas/tables below |
| Schema | ✅ | ✅ (ABAC scope) | ✅ (ABAC scope) | Tags cascade to tables below |
| Table (Managed) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Full governance |
| Table (External, on S3 bucket) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Full governance (standard S3) |
| Table (External, on FSx S3 AP) | ❌ **Blocked** | ❌ | ❌ | **CREATE TABLE fails — no governance possible** |
| Column | ✅ (via table) | ✅ (direct or ABAC) | — | Tags do NOT inherit to column level |
| External Location | ✅ (tag only) | ❌ | ❌ | Classification only, no query-time enforcement |

### Critical Limitation: FSx for ONTAP S3 AP

**Unity Catalog table creation on FSx S3 AP is currently blocked** (UC_CLOUD_STORAGE_ACCESS_FAILURE). This means:

![Databricks governance impact — UC governance blocked on FSx S3 AP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yoshiki0705/fsxn-lakehouse-integrations/main/docs/images/databricks-summary-governance-impact.png)

*Governance Impact Summary: Unity Catalog governance features (tags, masking, row filters, lineage) cannot be applied to FSx S3 AP data because table creation is blocked by the session policy.*

- ❌ Cannot apply governed tags to FSx S3 AP data as a UC table
- ❌ Cannot apply ABAC column masks to FSx S3 AP data
- ❌ Cannot apply row filter policies to FSx S3 AP data
- ❌ Cannot track data lineage for FSx S3 AP data
- ❌ Cannot use automated data classification on FSx S3 AP data

**Workaround (PoC only)**: Read data via boto3 → write to UC-managed table → apply governance there. This creates a copy and breaks the "zero-copy" value proposition.

### What Would Work (When UC Session Policy Is Resolved)

```python
# FUTURE: Full ABAC on FSx for ONTAP data (requires CREATE TABLE support)

# 1. Create governed tag
spark.sql("""
  CREATE GOVERNED TAG IF NOT EXISTS pii
  WITH ALLOWED_VALUES ('ssn', 'email', 'phone', 'address')
""")

# 2. Create External Table on FSx S3 AP
spark.sql("""
  CREATE TABLE fsxn_lakehouse.bronze.customer_data
  USING PARQUET
  LOCATION 's3://<s3ap-alias>/bronze/customers/'
""")

# 3. Apply governed tag to column
spark.sql("""
  ALTER TABLE fsxn_lakehouse.bronze.customer_data
  ALTER COLUMN ssn SET GOVERNED TAG pii = 'ssn'
""")

# 4. Create ABAC column mask policy
spark.sql("""
  CREATE COLUMN MASK POLICY mask_pii
  ON COLUMNS MATCHING (pii IN ('ssn', 'email'))
  USING (CASE WHEN is_account_group_member('data_admin') THEN col ELSE '***' END)
""")

# Result: SSN/email columns automatically masked for non-admin users
```

### Comparison with Snowflake

| Capability | Databricks (on FSx S3 AP) | Snowflake (on FSx S3 AP) |
|---|---|---|
| Tag creation | ✅ Works (governed tags) | ✅ Works (object tags) |
| Tag on External Table | ❌ **Blocked** (no table creation) | ✅ **Works** (verified) |
| Column masking | ❌ **Blocked** | ✅ Works (Enterprise Edition) |
| Row filtering | ❌ **Blocked** | ✅ Works (Enterprise Edition) |
| Auto PII classification | ❌ **Blocked** | ✅ Works (Enterprise Edition) |
| Tag inheritance | Catalog → Schema → Table | Database → Schema → Table → Column |
| Enforcement model | Query-time (UC engine) | Query-time (Snowflake engine) |

### Recommendation for Regulated Workloads

Until Databricks resolves the UC session policy boundary for S3 Access Points:

1. **For governed analytics on FSx for ONTAP data**: Use **Snowflake** (External Table + Tag-based Masking + Row Access Policy)
2. **For governed ML pipelines**: Stage data from FSx S3 AP into UC-managed storage (S3 bucket), then apply full ABAC governance
3. **For PoC/exploration only**: Use Instance Profile + boto3 with compensating controls (approval record, time-limited, audit logging)

### File-Level Access Control: ONTAP Native Layer

For NetApp users, the critical governance question is not just table/column-level masking but **file-level access control on unstructured data** (images, documents, videos). FSx for ONTAP S3 Access Points provide a dual-layer authorization model that applies regardless of whether Databricks UC governance is available:

```
Layer 1: AWS IAM + S3 AP Policy (who can call the S3 API)
    │
Layer 2: ONTAP File System Permissions (what files the user can access)
    │
    ├── Export Policy (NFS: client IP, protocol, RO/RW/root)
    ├── NTFS ACL / NFSv4 ACL (per-file/directory permissions)
    ├── Storage-Level Access Guard (volume-level ACL override)
    ├── FPolicy (file operation monitoring, screening, blocking)
    └── File System User mapping (S3 AP → UNIX/Windows identity)
```

#### How S3 AP File-Level Control Works

Each S3 Access Point is mapped to a **file system user**. All S3 API operations (including those from Databricks via boto3 or Spark) execute as that user:

| S3 AP Configuration | File Access Scope | Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| File system user = `root` (UID 0) | Full access to all files | Admin/analytics (broad read) |
| File system user = `ml_team` (UID 1001) | Only files readable by UID 1001 | ML team data isolation |
| File system user = `dept_finance` | Only finance department files | Department-level isolation |
| Multiple S3 APs per volume | Different users per AP | Per-team or per-workload scoping |

#### Per-Team S3 Access Points (Compensating Control for UC Gap)

Since Databricks UC governance is currently blocked on FSx S3 AP, file-level isolation via multiple access points provides a compensating control:

```
FSx for ONTAP Volume: /vol1
├── /training-data/   (owner: ml_team, mode: 750)
├── /sensitive-docs/  (owner: compliance, mode: 700)
├── /shared-assets/   (owner: root, mode: 755)
│
├── S3 AP "databricks-ml-team"     → file_system_user: ml_team
│     → Databricks ML cluster reads /training-data/ and /shared-assets/
│     → Cannot access /sensitive-docs/ (permission denied at ONTAP level)
│
├── S3 AP "databricks-compliance"  → file_system_user: compliance
│     → Compliance team reads /sensitive-docs/
│     → Separate Instance Profile, separate cluster
│
└── S3 AP "databricks-admin"       → file_system_user: root
      → Admin access for governance review
```

#### FPolicy: File Operation Monitoring & Blocking

FPolicy provides real-time file access monitoring at the ONTAP level — even when Databricks bypasses UC via Instance Profile + boto3:

| FPolicy Capability | Description | Relevance to Databricks |
|---|---|---|
| Native file blocking | Block specific file extensions | Prevent unwanted file types in ML pipelines |
| External FPolicy server | Send access events to external app | Audit trail when UC lineage is unavailable |
| File screening | Allow/deny based on file type | Control what data types ML jobs can access |
| Operation monitoring | Monitor all file operations | Compensating audit for boto3 PoC path |

**Key insight for NetApp users**: Even when Databricks bypasses Unity Catalog governance (via Instance Profile + boto3), ONTAP's file-level permissions and FPolicy still enforce access control at the storage layer. This provides a compensating control until UC session policy support is resolved.

### Integration: ONTAP File-Level Control × Databricks Tag Governance

The two governance layers (ONTAP file-level and Databricks ABAC) are designed to work together, but the current S3 AP session policy limitation creates a gap. Here's how they would integrate and what's available today:

#### Integration Matrix (Current State)

| Scenario | ONTAP Layer (File-Level) | Databricks Layer (ABAC) | Combined Effect | Status |
|---|---|---|---|:---:|
| **Department isolation** | Separate S3 AP per dept (different file_system_user) | Governed Tags classify tables by dept | Files physically inaccessible + ABAC masks on shared tables | ⚠️ ONTAP only (ABAC blocked) |
| **PII protection** | FPolicy monitors access to PII directories | ABAC Column Mask on PII-tagged columns | File access audited + column values masked | ⚠️ ONTAP only (ABAC blocked) |
| **ML training data control** | Export Policy limits which clusters can read | Governed Tags mark sensitivity on tables | Network restriction + column masking for sensitive features | ⚠️ ONTAP only (ABAC blocked) |
| **Ransomware defense** | ARP/AI detects encryption + auto-snapshot | N/A (storage-layer concern) | Storage protected; compute unaffected | ✅ Fully available |
| **Compliance hold** | SnapLock prevents file deletion | Row Filter restricts query results | Data immutable + query filtered by role | ⚠️ ONTAP only (Row Filter blocked) |
| **Cross-team data sharing** | Shared directory via common S3 AP | ABAC Row Filter by team role | All teams see table, each sees authorized rows | ⚠️ ONTAP only (ABAC blocked) |

#### How They Would Work Together (Future State)

```
1. Data scientist queries UC External Table on FSx S3 AP
       │
       ▼
2. Unity Catalog checks: user has SELECT privilege? ──── If NO → PermissionDenied
       │ YES
       ▼
3. Spark generates S3 API call (GetObject)
       │
       ▼
4. S3 AP Policy checks: IAM role allowed? ──── If NO → AccessDenied
       │ YES
       ▼
5. ONTAP checks: file_system_user has permission? ──── If NO → AccessDenied
       │ YES
       ▼
6. File data returned to Spark
       │
       ▼
7. UC applies ABAC Column Mask ──── PII columns masked based on governed tags
       │
       ▼
8. UC applies ABAC Row Filter ──── Unauthorized rows filtered based on tags
       │
       ▼
9. User sees: only authorized rows with sensitive columns masked
```

**Current reality**: Steps 1-2 fail at step "CREATE TABLE" (UC_CLOUD_STORAGE_ACCESS_FAILURE), so steps 7-9 are unreachable.

#### What's Available Today vs Future

| Governance Need | Available Today (ONTAP only) | Future (ONTAP + UC ABAC) |
|---|---|---|
| File-level isolation | ✅ Per-consumer S3 AP with scoped file_system_user | ✅ Same + UC table-level governance |
| Column masking | ❌ Not at file level (files are opaque blobs) | ✅ ABAC Column Mask on tagged columns |
| Row filtering | ❌ Not at file level | ✅ ABAC Row Filter on tagged tables |
| Access audit | ✅ FPolicy + CloudTrail S3 data events | ✅ Same + UC audit logs with lineage |
| Data immutability | ✅ SnapLock / Tamperproof Snapshot | ✅ Same (storage-layer, always available) |
| Ransomware protection | ✅ ARP/AI | ✅ Same (storage-layer, always available) |
| Data classification | ❌ Manual (file naming/directory structure) | ✅ Automated UC data classification |

#### Design Patterns for Combined Governance (Available Today)

| Pattern | ONTAP Configuration | Databricks Configuration | Governance Level |
|---|---|---|---|
| **File isolation (primary)** | Per-team S3 AP with scoped user | Separate Instance Profile per team | Strong (ONTAP-enforced) |
| **Audit trail (compensating)** | FPolicy external server | CloudTrail + custom logging in boto3 | Moderate (no UC lineage) |
| **Immutable training data** | SnapLock volume for training datasets | MLflow records source snapshot ID | Strong (storage-enforced) |
| **Network isolation** | VPC-scoped S3 AP + Export Policy | Customer-managed VPC + security groups | Strong (network-enforced) |

### AI/ML-Specific Scenarios

- **FlexCache for distributed training**: Cache training datasets from on-premises NAS to cloud FSx for ONTAP — Databricks clusters read locally cached data with sub-millisecond latency instead of crossing WAN. Write-back mode (available since May 2025) enables low-latency writes for feature engineering pipelines.
- **SnapLock for model governance**: Lock training data snapshots to ensure reproducibility — auditors can verify that the exact dataset used for model training has not been modified. Critical for regulated industries (healthcare, finance).
- **ARP/AI for data pipeline protection**: Detect and block ransomware that targets training data or model artifacts — automatic snapshot preserves clean state for recovery. Protects the entire ML data lifecycle from ingestion to serving.

## Getting Started

1. **Deploy infrastructure** — Follow the [Setup Guide](setup-guide.md)
2. **Configure External Location** — Set `access_point` field ([UC Integration](unity-catalog-integration.md))
3. **Test explicit file read** — Verify Spark read with known file path
4. **For PoC**: Configure Instance Profile on Dedicated cluster
5. **Track experiments** — Use MLflow regardless of access path
6. **Monitor**: Watch for Databricks platform updates on S3 AP support
